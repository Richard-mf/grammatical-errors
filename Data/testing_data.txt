For a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~a

Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family .|||41~42~Prep~to
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~a	14~15~Prep~on	36~37~Prep~about

This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~

Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .|||15~16~Vt~cause
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~	21~22~Prep~
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .|||2~3~Prep~
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing .|||25~26~Nn~members
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society .|||24~25~ArtOrDet~
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Prep~on	22~23~ArtOrDet~a	24~25~Prep~to

If anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it .|||3~4~Vt~happens	4~5~Prep~in
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .|||12~13~Prep~to
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~

With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier .|||20~21~Prep~as	21~22~Vform~being
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .|||28~29~Prep~for
First of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .|||9~10~Nn~rights
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~	18~18~Prep~against

Many people many argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~an	18~19~ArtOrDet~	30~31~ArtOrDet~
If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or she may have be scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~a

As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .|||25~26~Vform~being	28~29~Prep~of	43~44~Prep~of	44~45~Vform~having

The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves .|||22~23~Prep~from	23~24~Vform~affecting

Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .|||13~14~Prep~in
People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~a	11~12~Prep~from
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder to happen .|||21~22~Prep~from
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .|||41~41~ArtOrDet~the	58~59~ArtOrDet~known,the	73~74~Prep~for	81~82~ArtOrDet~a
As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .|||64~65~ArtOrDet~the	87~88~Prep~owing to	88~88~ArtOrDet~their	105~105~ArtOrDet~the	122~123~ArtOrDet~	173~174~Prep~	174~174~ArtOrDet~a	221~222~Prep~in
However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .|||7~8~Prep~to	8~9~Vform~reveal	18~20~Prep~	38~38~Prep~to	49~50~Prep~on	50~51~Nn~family	59~60~Nn~help	64~64~ArtOrDet~the	76~77~Nn~thousands	89~90~Nn~help	91~92~Nn~support	94~95~Nn~need	105~106~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .|||4~6~Vform~pass	41~41~ArtOrDet~the	55~55~ArtOrDet~the	82~83~ArtOrDet~the

As I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools .|||3~4~Prep~at	11~12~Prep~to
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision .|||10~11~Prep~for	16~17~ArtOrDet~the
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do .|||5~6~Prep~to	16~16~ArtOrDet~a	21~22~Nn~life
Nowadays , the use of the sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	10~11~ArtOrDet~
In increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~an
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole .|||24~25~Prep~on	36~37~Nn~society
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~	19~20~Nn~contact
As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online .|||13~14~Prep~

As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact people in real-life .|||26~26~Prep~with
Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .|||10~11~Prep~of
The reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~	12~13~ArtOrDet~	19~20~ArtOrDet~
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make the users stay is the links among the people .|||16~17~Prep~between	17~18~ArtOrDet~
However , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	4~5~Prep~in	6~6~ArtOrDet~a	17~18~ArtOrDet~
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements .|||20~21~Prep~	25~25~Prep~for	25~26~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
Social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now .|||6~7~Nn~peak	34~36~Vform~indulge
The users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with the their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~	35~36~ArtOrDet~

However , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills .|||17~18~Prep~
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .|||9~10~Prep~
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings .|||13~14~Nn~backgrounds	15~16~Prep~in
We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~	15~16~Nn~accounts
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected .|||24~25~Nn~fields
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his/her updates .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~a
This allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way .|||9~10~Prep~to
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~
For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .|||5~5~Prep~to	6~7~ArtOrDet~

As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .|||2~3~Vt~passes
The users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~all
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it .|||20~21~ArtOrDet~
