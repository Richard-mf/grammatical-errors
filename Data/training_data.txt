The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces .|||8~9~Prep~for	17~18~ArtOrDet~
It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	12~13~ArtOrDet~	17~18~Nn~disasters
A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there .|||20~21~Prep~
Besides a better usage of lands , a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath .|||5~6~Nn~land	7~8~ArtOrDet~	19~19~Vt~will

Engineers around the world had already started on working on this problem .|||4~5~Vt~have
To guide them in this heavy responsibility of saving the earth , they use a set of simple steps which guide them in engineering a remedy , known as the Engineering Design Process .|||13~14~Vt~have used
Firstly , we can define this worldwide problem as the search of alternative resources to the existing near-depletion fuels .|||11~12~Prep~for
Studies had shown that an average of 2 lbs ( pounds ) of fuel is needed to produce 1kilowatt of power .|||1~2~Vt~have

Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .|||8~9~Nn~resources
This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .|||17~18~Vt~
21st century will be a more competitive and challenging opportunity for China to develop .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The
If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~an
Statistics show that the numbers are only continuing to grow with the existing population explosion .|||4~5~Nn~number
This determines how accurate the engineer might have been in his work and also if he looked at nature as a considerable factor during his designing process .|||6~8~Vt~has	16~16~Vt~has

The process of developing a new product based on innovation is not an easy task for the innovators .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
The innovators , who are normally work under Research and Development department , have to recognize the needs from the public or through research , are require to spend countless days and nights to understand the problems , to produce solutions to the problems , to convert the solutions into practical products and to commercialize them .|||0~2~ArtOrDet~Innovators	7~8~Prep~with	8~8~ArtOrDet~a	26~27~Vform~required
By diffusion and adoption of the innovation products by the public or specific users , the innovators have to face the consequences .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
Innovators required development fund in order to obtain their needs , such as hardware equipments , to work on their prototypes .|||1~2~Vt~require
But at times , there are some critical situations that happen or affect to the manufacturing company , the innovators somehow get to be involve too .|||13~14~Prep~
Then the innovators have to stop all works for the development .|||7~8~Nn~work
For another example , during this recent economic downturn , most of the major manufacturing companies are slowing down in manufacturing productions and releasing of new products .|||24~25~Prep~
This shows that the manufacturing companies are trying to reduce the unnecessary burden to maintain the companies ' stand .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , this is one of the major factors that will definitely affect the innovators from developing innovation products .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
Another challenge that the innovators need to be concern about is commercializing the finalize products .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
There are cases that marketing department do not wish to market the innovated products due to various reasons .|||5~6~Nn~departments
Another example is the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high ; therefore , they fail to obtain the sales target for the selling the innovated product .|||27~28~ArtOrDet~
So , this is another major factor that the innovators have to face .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
In brief , innovators have to face many challenges when they want to develop the products .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~new
They have to obtain fund from the investors in order to develop their innovation prototypes and require help from the marketing department to have their innovation products for sales in the marketplace .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~

Because Engineering designs are always related to real problem , during the five processes , the obstacles they face are more than theories and calculations on paper .|||8~9~Nn~problems
But such explanation was of non-sense as the engineers did not see such possibility during their designing ; otherwise the design would not be carried out at all .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~an	4~5~Prep~	13~13~ArtOrDet~a

Another problem , financial issue , is quite common during design process .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
It affects the analyzing and test step most seriously though it can affect almost every step of design work .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
For most design work , the engineers are always employed by some organizations or companies .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~

Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The engineering
As we understand the relevance and importance of engineering design , we will come to realize that in reality there are several factors that preventing the progress of engineering design .|||24~25~Vform~prevent
Firstly , engineering design process has come to incur excessive costs .|||4~5~Nn~processes
In Singapore , there is only a certain fixed amount in the country 's national budget allocated of the research and development sector .|||17~18~Prep~to
Moreover , the government has also other financial plans in spending their resources .|||9~11~Vform~to spend
Hence , the area of innovative research and development in engineering is not driven in full swing .|||14~15~Prep~to
In countries like China and India , their population amount to billions whereas the population of Singapore is only 4.5 million .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~the	10~11~Prep~in	11~11~ArtOrDet~the
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
In areas of mechanical engineering , our latest machineries are either bought or are replicas from the models in Japan .|||15~16~Prep~of	16~17~ArtOrDet~
The impact on having a limited amount of creative people has resulted in Singapore having to resort to buying foreign-based engineering design equipment from overseas .|||2~3~Prep~of
Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .|||16~16~Prep~in
The invention of refrigerator was around 1910s as before that , people had faced the problem of food storage in summer when there was no icehouse could be used .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	5~6~Prep~in	6~6~ArtOrDet~the	12~14~Vform~were facing
Research and development had been done to solve this problem and eventually boosted the invention of refrigerator .|||3~5~Vt~was	16~16~ArtOrDet~the

Thus post-it note was invented from this idea .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
In this manner , many other serendipitous technologies have been discovered and solved many irrelevant problems .|||12~12~Vform~have
Under this process , the attractiveness and practicality of the inventions will be improved such that they could be converted into useful products which accepted by most people .|||0~1~Prep~In	11~13~Vt~are	17~18~Vt~can	24~24~Vform~are

From these two examples above , it is clear that another similarity between conventional technology and serendipitous technology is the process of development and commercialization which involved a lot of hard work .|||26~27~Vt~involve
Research is usually based on certain organizations and it requires some time , funds and resources before the researchers can finally obtain the expected results .|||4~5~Prep~in

For the post-it pads , its idea was just generated from the failed product when 3M researches tried to invent new bonding agent .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~a	20~20~ArtOrDet~a
Yet for conventional technology , it is limited to people with professional knowledge , like : researchers or scientists .|||1~2~Prep~
In conclusion , although serendipitous technology seems easier than research-based technology for research process , it still requires a lot of hard work to further develop it and one should acquire the essential knowledge before he know how the unexpected discoveries can been used to solve the problems we faced .|||11~12~Prep~in	12~12~ArtOrDet~the

Apart from the demands from business and education , other factors have also shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions have been designed to meet the needs .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~these
An example could be the virtual training used by the U.S. army where military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology .|||2~4~Vform~is	4~5~ArtOrDet~

However , problems inevitably generate and affect the process of innovation due to the improper strategies or methods .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
One is that some engineering designs do not meet the needs of market .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
In other words , these designs are produced without adequate market survey , so they turn out to be unwelcomed among public .|||20~21~Prep~by	21~21~ArtOrDet~the
Though the designs are products of fantastic conception , they become useless as rubbish once out of market .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~the
After the policy of reform and opening-up , Chinese government has long been encouraging people to make varieties of innovations .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Nevertheless , it does not mean that whatever designs can be made .|||8~9~Nn~design

The second problem to hamper engineering design process that I can concern is the patent policy .|||7~8~Nn~processes
China has long been a great country of patents , but the success of patents is quite rare .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~these
Most Chinese patents are " Appearance Patent " , not " Innovation Patent " .|||6~7~Nn~Patents	12~13~Nn~Patents
Appearance patent is a rather tough issue and among patent infringement in China , more than 90 % belong to this kind .|||1~2~Nn~patents	9~9~ArtOrDet~the

In conclusion , China is sparing no efforts to solve problems in order to make innovations real intellectual product .|||18~19~Nn~products
As a developing country , now China is facing problems on many fields .|||10~11~Prep~in
The problems bring some effect on engineering design from two aspect , independent innovation and engineering application .|||8~9~Prep~in	10~11~Nn~aspects
It is accepted that Chinese student are good at science .|||5~6~Nn~students
They have solid foundation on math and physics , they can solve complex and difficult problems in short time .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~a	4~5~Prep~for
China 's education is typical exam-oriented education .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
Under this mode of education for long time , people 's thinking is limited and rigid .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~a

Besides , there are still many inadequacies in the policy of science and industry .|||9~10~Nn~policies
In China , economic policy is very wide but policy on industry is strict .|||4~6~Nn~policies are	9~10~Nn~policies
For example , investment and concerns that the nation put on technology research and engineering are deficient ( Xin , 2005 ) .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
However , the policy of engineering and industry can not meet the needs .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~these
The state only put investment on specialized research institutes .|||5~6~Prep~in
In the actual production and application , the support from government is not nearly enough .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
The two problems would bring some effects on engineering design and innovation for China .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~These	12~13~Prep~in
First , under the mode of education , most engineers and scientist are relatively weak at creativity .|||11~12~Nn~scientists	15~16~Prep~in
This will directly affects the process on engineering design of innovation especially on raising solutions .|||1~2~Vt~	6~7~Prep~of
In the technological age , since independent innovation is very important to a nation 's development , society needs the people with innovative talent .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~the	19~20~ArtOrDet~
If engineers do not come up with new ideas , they can not find best solution for the problems .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
Moreover , the policy on science and engineering also affects process of engineering application due to insufficient investment in research and engineering practice .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
As a result , the engineering design would be in slow progress and there are still a lot of complex problems left unsolved .|||7~9~Vform~is
If engineers are in defect of creativity and innovation , it is difficult for them to study new issues and make improvement .|||21~22~Nn~improvements
This article will focus on two major problems that hamper innovational process of engineering in China and their impact on certain stage of the process .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the	20~21~ArtOrDet~a particular
China industry is mostly at the lower end of the world production chain , which means the production in China is energy- consuming , labour-intensive , but not so profitable .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
Although China devotes a lot of resources into production , the added value for innovation is low .|||7~8~Prep~to
The reason why this factory gets so little is that the design belongs to that Japanese company .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore , very little money is devoted to design process for innovation and these companies only repeat this low-end production circle .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
In addition to China 's low-end industrial structure , the bad situation of intellectual property protection also hampers engineering innovational process .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
In China intellectual property right is not well-protected .|||4~5~Nn~rights
People can find pirate version of software in most cities .|||4~5~Nn~versions
There are some products which directly copy the design of foreign companies .|||7~9~Nn~designs
To sum up , China 's low-end industrial structure and bad situation of intellectual property protection are the two major problems that hamper engineering design process in China .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
Low-end production pattern makes companies focus on cutting cost , rather than making innovation , while lack of protection for innovation makes people unwilling to generate new ideas .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~the low-end
When China tries to promote engineering design process for innovations , these are the two problems China should tackle .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~Nn~innovation

During the old days , there was no laptop , but got only desktop that workers had to share one machine to do their mass work , which caused great inconvenience .|||0~1~Prep~In	27~29~Vform~causing
In order to solve this problem , a person called Mizoguchi in Toshiba Company came up with the idea of inventing laptop ( Rogers , 2003 ) .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the
Till now , laptop is still a necessary tool in people 's daily life .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
Thus , after briefly viewing the development of laptop , we can conclude that , the appearance of this marvelous invention was initially driven by the demands of people , and then its development was supported by technologies .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	28~28~ArtOrDet~the
However , in the consideration that electric cars could not travel far distance , and it was not convenient to get battery charged , electric cars finally lost out in the market , due to the restriction of usefulness .|||12~13~Nn~distances	21~22~Nn~batteries

In this way , people no longer have to worry about the exhaust of gasoline resources .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~

Improve on the current battery technology is one of the engineering design process to solve air pollution .|||0~1~Vform~Improving	1~2~Prep~
The reasons are ; short lifespan for the battery , maximum distance travelled before recharging is relatively short , relatively more costly .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
" By improving the battery technology to meet these shortcomings , the world will be willing to switch to electric cars , the more environmental friendly chose .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~

For my home country , China , although its design process for innovation has been improved a lot , there still remain several factors which hamper the innovation process significantly .|||14~15~Vt~
Employees of state-owned enterprises do n't have to worry the financial matter and are free from pressure .|||9~12~Nn~financial matters
Due to the political interference in stated-owned enterprises , state-owned enterprises and other type of enterprises do not compete against each other on an equal basis .|||2~3~Nn~
Firstly , the directors and manager of the state-owned enterprises exploit their position and power in the company to advance their own private interests .|||5~6~Nn~managers
Furthermore , the motivations for most employees working in state-owned enterprises are pursuing the impressive salary and welfare .|||3~4~Nn~motivation	12~13~Vform~to pursue	13~14~ArtOrDet~	15~16~Nn~salaries
They are lazy and not interested in discovering .|||7~8~Vform~discovery
Even if employees encounter some precious ideas by chance , they may not want to put effort into doing research and converting the ideas into production .|||16~16~Nn~some
Thus , the above two impacts will affect the design stage , development stage significantly .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Since stated-owned enterprises play important roles in controlling and leading other type of enterprises in China , this will hamper China 's design process for innovation from macroscopic view .|||11~12~Nn~types	17~18~ArtOrDet~
Apart from the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises , economic shortage of China 's private companies also hampers the innovation process .|||13~14~Prep~among
One is the undesirable production .|||2~3~Nn~
Since most high quality and accurate equipment is very expensive , some private companies could not afford it .|||14~15~Vt~can
The poor equipment in private companies may lead to large uncertainty in design stage .|||0~1~Nn~	12~12~ArtOrDet~the
This could further lead to undesirable productions .|||6~7~Nn~production
In addition , due to the economic shortage , private companies may not be able to hire people with high-educated knowledge and rich experience .|||5~6~Nn~
Among them , the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises and the economic shortage of private companies are the two main causes .|||3~4~Nn~
It is widely believed that there is not any strong connection between technology innovations and examinations which is based on MCQs .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~	13~14~Nn~innovation
However , it still does .|||4~5~Vt~is
Comparing two typical examples of innovations of two kinds , penicillin and vaccine discovery , we will notice some similarities as well as differences in terms of three main fields : progress of research , financial inputs and overall impact .|||5~6~Nn~innovation	16~17~Vt~
With penicillin discovery , such technology can be considered a huge serendipitous observation .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
By contrast , vaccine discovery is a kind of technology based on a sequence of basic research , followed by applied research , leading to development .|||5~6~Vt~involved	25~25~ArtOrDet~the
By this way , all the processes are often set up from the beginning , though sometimes mistakes were found and need adopting .|||7~8~Vt~were
Many people are strongly convicted that conventional research is often more costly than serendipitous one .|||13~13~Nn~a
On the contrary , in some cases the opposite applied when a unexpected observation 's financial supports was in fact much higher than those of scientific one .|||25~25~Nn~a
For instance , the discovery of penicillin , though a big serendipitous observation , still costs as many of financial supports as the discovery of vaccine .|||15~16~Vt~cost	17~18~Nn~much
In short , it can be concluded from the comparison between penicillin and vaccine discovery that the kind of research , whether conventional or serendipity , does say nothing about the financial supports for it .|||16~17~Nn~	32~33~Nn~support	33~34~Prep~
Last but not least , it would be mistaken without mentioning the importance of two kinds of research on our society .|||10~11~Vform~mention	18~19~Prep~in
However , their impacts on the whole society are still different in that : While vaccine discovery was initially carried to resolve a problem recognized before , the success of penicillin discovery is beyond our expectation .|||3~4~Nn~impact

However , many companies in China are still puzzled with lack of innovative product and many enterprisers are looking forward revolutionary innovation to come .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~a
This paper will point out two main problems which hamper engineering design process for innovation and state their respective impact on certain stages of the process .|||12~13~Nn~processes
The low technological standard is one of the significant factors which hamper engineering design process .|||0~1~Nn~	14~15~Nn~processes
This problem is classified as " immature technologies , mismatch between new technology and production capacity , lack of technical personnel or brain drain " .|||4~5~Prep~
In China , some of the graduate students from design school may go overseas to seek more professional mentors while some of them change their profession since they do not have much opportunity to develop their talents .|||10~11~Nn~schools
For those who manage to enter design industry and start innovative work , their exposure to advanced technology is limited .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
( Mootee , 2009 ) Due to these reasons , some China enterprisers do not pay much attention on innovation but concentrate more on copying and modifying western technology instead of investing on innovative product .|||18~19~Prep~to
This problem curbs the development of engineering design process at the very beginning .|||8~9~Nn~processes
Therefore most of China enterprisers focus on short-run product and expect instant profit .|||8~9~Nn~products
Another problem hampering engineering design process is that proprietary intellectual property is not highly valued in China .|||5~6~Nn~processes
The inventors of the decoded product fail to gain benefit that they should get .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~	3~4~ArtOrDet~	5~6~Nn~products
Since their Intellectual Property Rights are not protected , people are discouraged to put in effort in the engineering design process .|||20~21~Nn~processes
Recently , the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People 's Republic of China announced that Intellectual Property Rights are the power of the development of enterprises .|||23~24~Prep~to
( Cabinet Approves Intellectual Property Rights Guidelines , 2008 ) The related regulation and law were also issued and implemented to ensure the rights of inventors are reserved .|||10~11~Nn~	12~13~Nn~regulations	14~15~Nn~laws
The government believes that this will improve the engineering design process for innovation in the near future .|||10~11~Nn~processes
To sum up , there are two main problems that widely recognized as the factors that hamper engineering design process , namely low technological standards and not highly valued proprietary intellectual property .|||19~20~Nn~processes
In order to improve engineering design process and increase people 's passion for innovation , China needs to solve these main problems .|||6~7~Nn~processes
Other than this international regulation , environmental concern is also an important determining factor in shaping nuclear technological innovations .|||18~19~Nn~innovation
The notorious Chernobyl accident which caused 30 immediate deaths and affected an area of a 30 kilometer radius also reminds us of nuclear technology 's potential for causing disasters from time to time ( World nuclear association , 2009 ) .|||13~14~Prep~within

In an era which the scale of our industrial system is growing larger and larger , the consumption of resource becomes an incredible burden on the environment and people start to suffer the aftermath for the destruction and pollution we have done to the environment , a series of social issues concerning engineering and environment have been raised .|||19~20~Nn~resources
In this essay , how does engineering design processes cope with the energy crisis will be discussed in terms of gathering pertinent information and analysis and selection of an optimized solution .|||26~28~Vform~selecting
Designing a new industrial system or product which works more efficient with less energy consumption is a complicated process thus needs sufficient analysis on information .|||23~24~Prep~of
Only by doing this we can make it clear that what the state quo of energy consumption is and whether a proposal is applicable .|||6~8~Vform~be

This shows the power of bar code .|||6~7~Nn~codes
Bar code , being familiar as black lines with numbers , is a " method of automatic identification and data collection " ( Bellis , n.d. , para 1 ) .|||1~2~Nn~codes
Through decades of development , bar code has been shaped by social factors to some extent .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
The users , especially retailers and product manufacturers , play important roles in improving bar code .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
Firs and foremost , bar code emerged and developed as the times required .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
According to Seideman ( n.d. ) , as early as in 1890 people realised their need and invented punch cards which played partial role of bar code .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
However , the first application area of bar code was not supermarket or grocery but railroads .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Unfortunately , the implementation of bar code in railroad industry failed because it did not fit the industry perfectly and its functions were not completely utilized .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	8~8~ArtOrDet~the
On the other hand , retailers then were just in need of a system like bar code .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the
In 1966 , a grocery industry meeting regarding implementation of bar code was held by RCA ( Seideman , n.d. ) .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
Today the demands of users are still shaping bar code , expanding it to more application fields like libraries and post industry .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	20~20~ArtOrDet~the
Another factor that affects bar code 's development is the economic concerns .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~ArtOrDet~
As bar code is designed to store information of the products , all products have to be labelled .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~ArtOrDet~
Besides , users have to buy devices that read bar code as well .|||10~11~Nn~codes
Due to this reason , bar code was not broadly implemented as soon as it was invented .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
Having settled the economic concerns of users , bar code wins users ' heart quickly .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	10~11~Vt~won	13~14~Nn~hearts
Since its first read in 1974 , bar code has been adopted for 35 years ( Shih , 2009 ) .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
The economic factors have been shaping bar code and making it survive even facing the great competitor RFID ( Shih , 2009 ) .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
In addition to the demands and economic concerns , the wide range of users helps to improve bar code .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	17~17~ArtOrDet~the
It promotes bar code to be developed into an internationally recognized and commonly readable system .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
It is clear that globalization is inevitable which means bar code has to adjust itself to meet globalization .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
To sum up , bar code is an important technology .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
Because of users ' demands , financial capability of users and wide range of users , bar code is shaped to an innovation which is globally recognized and essential to the world .|||18~19~Vt~has been
The shortage of natural resources mean that all raw materials required for engineering design process for innovations would have to come from import .|||22~23~Nn~imports
This by itself poses problems such as greater cost incurred for innovations , shipment fees , as well as a delay in engineering design process .|||8~9~Nn~costs	21~23~ArtOrDet~the
This is because the designing process usually involves a lot of trial and error , using various materials for different parts of the innovation , in order to optimize the best working condition for the item of innovation .|||32~33~Nn~conditions
The long shipping time and greater cost due to importing of raw materials delayed the engineering design process as they only have a plan of the race car but no chance to physically fabricate the parts and build the car , while the raw materials are still on their way to Singapore Another problem which could greatly affect the engineering process for designing is a lack of funding .|||21~22~Vt~had	45~46~Vt~were
The designing process requires a large amount of raw materials for repeated fabrications of each part with different material in order to obtain the most suitable material to optimize the function of the product of innovation .|||18~19~Nn~materials
Even for the same kind of material , it might have to be used several times as the parts fabricated is not necessarily always in the expected condition when it is first made , resulting in a wastage and hence greater consumption of raw materials and therefore a greater cost incurred in the designing process .|||18~19~Nn~part

The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .|||7~8~Vt~is
According to Yang ( 2007 ) , " when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife 's apron to clean the table .|||10~11~Vt~was
After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .|||2~2~Vform~had
Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~a
If Noble is not a prudential person and do not do his experiments and observe the phenomenon seriously though he is hardworking he may never invent the new explosive successfully .|||2~3~Vt~was	8~9~Vt~did	25~26~Vform~have invented
But without the prudential attitude towards science he may miss his good luck and did not go on finding how can this phenomenon occur .|||9~10~Vform~have missed
As both of them are explosive , people use them to exploit mines , tear down great buildings and provide a high temperature for many chemical experiments .|||5~7~Nn~explosives

However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevent people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .|||16~17~Vform~prevents
Two of these problems involve the special political environment and Chinese people 's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
As Michael Keane ( 2007 ) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals to material production .|||22~23~Prep~
In current stage , political environment and people 's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
The post-it notes are resulted from a serendipitous discovery , while the super glue is developed gradually via standard research process .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~	14~15~Vt~was
However , it turns out later that the serendipitous discovery actually has no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what it has been expected at the beginning .|||3~4~Vt~turned	11~12~Vt~had	32~34~Vt~was
The next stage research is to use the scientific method to fulfill the previous target .|||4~5~Vt~was
So we can find that the super glue 's inventor successfully find what he needs while the post-it notes ' inventor create a strange glue that is low adhesive but re-adherable .|||11~12~Vt~found	14~15~Vt~needed	21~22~Vt~created
In this stage , the difference between the two kinds of discoveries turns to be that the serendipitous discovery 's inventor could not meet his initial needs like the normal inventor but accidently create a totally different product instead .|||12~13~Vt~turned
And from the third stage onward , the post-it notes and the super glue finally share the similarity .|||15~16~Vt~shared
One is low adhesive but re-adherable so is used to make notes that can be attached to documents and other surfaces freely .|||1~2~Vt~was	7~8~Vt~was
The other one is high adhesive and functions quickly so can be used to glue many materials quickly with great strength .|||3~4~Vt~was	7~8~Vt~functioned
The inventors both find their usages and successfully make them more practical and considerate .|||3~4~Vt~found	8~9~Vt~made
One important technology which was shaped by a specific group of users is electric vehicles , which had been shaped by four different factors that are technical , economic factors , social , and political changes .|||17~18~Vt~have
Technical factor is one of the four elements that determine the development of electric vehicle .|||9~10~Vt~have determined	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Compared to the structure of a conventional automobile , electric vehicle has a similar structure but different components .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Electric vehicle has a lighter weight as most of its parts are made up of aluminium .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The electric
On the other hand , electric vehicle utilizes electrical energy by using batteries , so the engine is relatively clean , emission-free and quiet .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	10~11~Prep~from
However , there are less charging stations and electric vehicle requires a long recharge time .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Economically , technology for electric vehicles had not widely met the need because less promotion was held and there was a mass production of gasoline type automobiles .|||6~7~Vt~have
Furthermore , electric vehicles were not advertised in precise manners .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~a	9~10~Nn~manner
Besides , declined cost in oil in the past encouraged people to buy gasoline cars .|||2~3~Vt~declining
In the end , gasoline vehicles controlled the monopoly on automobiles in market .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Compared to conventional vehicles that are available now , electric vehicles are socially determined in several reasons : limited range of electric vehicles , beliefs and values of the society today .|||14~15~Prep~by
Despite several advantages , their interests towards electric cars are fading .|||5~6~Nn~interest	6~7~Prep~in
In addition , political factors can affect how the sales of vehicles go , which include government 's adherence to this technology .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the

According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , skunkwork refers to a small group of highly selected people designated to do research for an innovation without carry out tedious organization procedures .|||25~26~Vform~carrying
While conventional research requires the researchers to do large amount of reports , discussions and management procedures , skunkwork provides pathway to develop an invention quickly without being constrained by bureaucratic processes .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~a

According to Rogers , E. M. ( 2003 ) , development of engineering design process consists of a total six main stages namely , needs/problems , research ( basic and applied ) , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences respectively.1 The whole design process of creating new products is tedious and will take very long time to complete the research process , and then to the development stage .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the	12~12~ArtOrDet~an	56~56~ArtOrDet~a
In this manner , most of the development of engineering design process carried out in Singapore end at the development stage .|||11~12~Nn~processes	12~12~Vt~are	17~18~Prep~of
First of all , for the NUS eco-car innovation process , it is true that the development of eco-car is indeed environmental friendly .|||21~22~Vform~environmentally
However , if eco-car is to proceed on with the commercialization stage in the engineering design process , the problem encountered by my home country is the capital cost .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	8~9~Prep~to	26~27~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore , hiring skilled workers and buying machine to assemble car are costly as well .|||7~8~Nn~machines	10~10~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , for the eco-car to be launched in Singapore in its commercialization stage of the design process , the production of car will result in significantly increased in cost of retail price due to the high prices of raw materials in constructing of car .|||10~11~Prep~during	27~28~Vt~increase	28~29~Prep~	31~31~ArtOrDet~the

On the other hand , for the NUS Haptic Chair innovation process , the researchers had successfully developed the chair for the convenience of the deaf people in Singapore .|||24~25~ArtOrDet~
The problem that hampers the design process is the shortage of testers to test on the product , for which according to the article3 that there were not enough deaf children in Singapore to test this product .|||14~15~Prep~	24~25~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , there will be no guarantee to the effectiveness to see how the product can be utilized and researcher will not be able to do modification and optimization to the chair for better performance .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , capital cost and the shortage of human resources are two of the problems which will significantly hamper engineering design process innovation , which may result in an impact of commercialization stage unable to be realized .|||32~32~ArtOrDet~the	34~38~Vform~being unable to realise
Out of the 6 stages , I will be elaborating about problems in the research and development stage with reference to examples that occurred in Singapore .|||8~10~Vt~elaborate	10~11~Prep~on
In Singapore , the research sector is one of the best funded field , besides education and defense .|||12~13~Nn~fields
Examples of common problems in the research sector are lack of skilled labour , time constraint and budget .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~Some
However , in NUS , the project is of student level only .|||8~9~Prep~at
With additional guidance from experienced engineers , the eco- car could have been better designed at probably have a better chance to be marketed .|||21~23~Vform~of being

After all , the simulation done on computers can not be compared to what the students experienced .|||16~16~Vt~have
The success of the design will be based on the yearly race competition held on an international level .|||14~15~Prep~at	15~16~ArtOrDet~
To sum up , lack of skilled labour and inability to re-create computer simulation in real life are not the only 2 problems commonly faced in engineering design process in Singapore .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	9~9~ArtOrDet~the	26~26~ArtOrDet~the
As a result , the lack of fund will hamper the progress of the design process as there is no material to manufacture a physical product to test its usefulness .|||18~19~Vt~will be
For example in the aero plane design process , one needs to determine the material to be use as the body of the aircraft .|||17~18~Vform~used
Without the knowledge of the characteristics of different materials , one will not be able to choose the best material , which must be strong yet light in weight , to be use .|||32~33~Vform~used
In the case of lacking of funds , companies need to find sponsorships to fund the cost of their design process .|||20~21~Nn~processes
To illustrate it simply , one current need of modern people is the demand for a consistent energy source .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~this
Therefore , engineering design process aims to invent a technology approach to meet people 's need .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , demand for effective energy supply is the major need of modern people .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	8~9~ArtOrDet~a
The main energy source nowadays is fossil fuel energy which has limited storage in the earth .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~a limited storage

Their advantage mainly embodies in respect that they are all renewable energy source .|||12~13~Nn~sources
Among them , solar energy is the best choice because it is safer than nuclear energy and easier to be obtained than geothermal energy .|||19~21~Vform~obtain
The whole process is like installing a solar penal containing many tubes on the roof of the house where the penal can be maximally exposes to the sunlight .|||23~25~Vt~exposed maximally	26~27~ArtOrDet~

Then how does refrigerator come into being ?|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
Some factors such as the demand of lead user , economic factors , and environmental concern actually play important roles in shaping refrigerator into its shape today .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~the
In the first place , the lead user of refrigerator is the first and most important factor that drives the development of refrigerator .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Lead user can be defined as a group of people that have the greatest need towards a potential invention .|||1~2~Nn~users	15~16~Prep~for
According to Hippel ( cited by Rogers , 2003 ) , lead user plays an important role in most of the innovation-designing process , because they usually have the needs of innovations that are " well ahead of the general market " .|||12~13~Nn~users
In the case of refrigerator , lead user can be regarded as the food businessmen in 20th century , mainly because most food would perish very fast under normal temperature .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	7~8~Nn~users
Since the lead user has such a great need on a product that could help them keep the food cool easily , refrigerator was first commercially introduced to long distance food transportation in 1900s ( Bowden & Offer , 1994 ) .|||9~10~Prep~of	22~22~ArtOrDet~the
Lead user therefore started the application of refrigerator on business .|||1~2~Nn~users	7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Beside the factor of lead user , which we can consider as people 's demand , the economic factor is also an important part that shapes the refrigerator .|||5~6~Nn~users	16~17~ArtOrDet~
One of the evidence of this is that the use of refrigerator was only being widespread after its price drops to a level that could be accepted by the norms .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the	19~20~Vt~has dropped
Before the release of refrigerator into the large potential market of common household , there is an ideal substitute for electric refrigerator gas refrigerator , which has a quieter operation and longer use duration ( Cowan , cited by Roger , 2003 ) .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	20~20~ArtOrDet~the
The reason why all of us now are using the " huming " electric refrigerator instead of the gas one is that the corporations decided the electric refrigerator would bring them larger profit , and therefore they went all out to promote the electric refrigerator .|||22~23~ArtOrDet~	24~24~Vt~have

The society factors such as economic factors , political decision , and technological advancement advertising and even military demands can affects the development of technological innovation .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~	9~10~Nn~decisions

Throughout the history , many innovations were created not for its intended application .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , innovation process has six stages : needs/problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and consequences .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
One of such cases is Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~The
Early United States government policy and cold war situation shaped the invention of GPS .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~The	6~6~ArtOrDet~the

Soon after this , when the surveying market boomed in 1980s , the demand for GPS and the money generated also contributes to the development of GPS for civilian use .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~The 1980'ss
Towards its development , GPS technology has few setbacks .|||6~7~Vt~had a
The example also shows how economy and politics are interrelated in determining an innovation .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~The
Hence , the technology development is partly socially determined .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
As modern society is developing fast in the new century , human 's need becomes more and more diversified while problems of the shortage of resources get more and more serious .|||12~13~Nn~
Such kind of conflict requires engineers to develop new products to meet all needs .|||1~2~Nn~kinds
Designing products and finding solutions require a long term process , which is defined as engineering design process .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~The
According to Khandani , engineering design process is a very important route for engineers to create products and it can be expressed as a 5-step process , which includes " Define the problem " , " Gather pertinent information " , " Generate multiple solutions " , " Analyze and select a solution " , and " Test and implement the solution " ( Khandani , 2005 ) .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~The
Among them are the problem of plagiarism and the insufficiency of fund support for scientific research .|||4~5~Nn~problems
Many students just search sources on the Internet and submit their " work " perfunctorily , never to mention about the copyrights of the original researchers or writers .|||17~19~Vt~mentioning
However , such choice becomes harmful in the long run as the innovative skills of university students or researchers deteriorated .|||3~4~Nn~choices	19~20~Vt~will deteriorate
For example , an engineering student who is doing a designing project do not have to analyze or select solutions , which is the fourth step in the engineering design process , if he wants to plagiarize from other articles .|||12~13~Vt~does
Instead , plagiarism directly gives the final and the best solution for the student , which seems good for him but quite harmful for the entire academic community .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
If everyone plagiarizes to do their academic work and only tries his luck to get higher marks , the problem of plagiarism may result in a more serious situation , that is , very few students graduated from universities can manage to develop innovative products as engineers .|||36~37~Vt~graduating
The problem has significant impacts on the step of testing and implementing solutions in the design process , during which an engineer may encounter different problems and choices .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~a	4~5~Vt~impact
Although the academic community in my home country is facing many problems hampering innovations , the development of the science and technology has never been pulled down .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~which hamper	18~19~ArtOrDet~

Nonetheless , luck is not the only determining factor for the birth of a technology , whether it is developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery .|||23~24~Vt~resulting
There are other contributing factors such as the efforts of the inventors and their determinations to succeed that lead to the discovery of the technology .|||18~19~Vt~leads

In the view of social construction of technology , many technological innovations and inventions are influenced and shaped by social factors ( Rogers , 2003 ) .|||0~1~Prep~from
These factors mainly include the investment of companies , need of customers as well as purpose of saving energy .|||9~10~Nn~needs
First of all , the main reason for this innovation is that the major corporations such as General Electric , General Motors , Kelvinator , and Westinghouse consider that investing in electric refrigerators instead of gas refrigerators would be able to produce more profit ( Rogers , 2003 ) .|||10~11~Vform~was	27~28~Vt~considered
Refrigerators with better mechanism as well as working capacity are demanded by the market .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~a

What the customers are willing to buy gave rise to the preference of companies .|||3~4~Vt~were
Production decisions are made to meet the market demand and maximize the profit , and the root of the decisions lies in customers ' expectation .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~
The limited resource is a social problem which is the concern of both customers and producers who facilitate the invention significantly .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~
This is an instance of social factors that have largely influenced and shaped the technological innovation .|||7~8~Vt~
Many products in the world do not appear from nowhere , but they are made based on the creativity of engineers in the response to human needs .|||5~6~Vt~did	13~14~Vt~were	22~23~Vt~

Creativity will not stop at one place ; it will move on from time to time to improve the appliances or devices .|||4~5~Prep~in
Based on Khandani ( 2005 ) , there are five phases of design process which will be elaborated in subsequent paragraphs .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
The first step of defining the problem is very important so that an engineer would not lost on the way finding the solution .|||16~17~Vt~lose

The Cold War and arms race stimulated the research and development of all technological fields in the U.S. including improving communication infrastructure between the government and military planners .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the

However , with the application of genetic testing , some problems are revealed gradually , such as whether the patients should tell their families about their testing results .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
In fact , everyone has to be responsible for the health of their families and themselves , hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the testing results , and these results should be made known to their relatives .|||13~14~Nn~family	15~16~Nn~himself or herself
If the person does not tell his families about the test results , his families would not know their health deficiencies and would not tell their doctors .|||7~8~Nn~family	14~15~Nn~family members

Firstly , a couple who is planning get marry and one of them or a close relative of them has an inherited disease is advised to take up genetic testing .|||7~9~Vt~to get married

Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens ( Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , n.d. ) .|||13~13~Nn~a

Secondly , being able to access one 's genetic information will reveal the list of diseases one is susceptible to , and the one who possesses the information may have ulterior interest .|||30~30~ArtOrDet~an

Therefore , individuals whom requested for genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .|||3~4~Vt~who have
Research has shown that individuals tend to keep risk information to themselves ( Forrest , 2000 ) , but disease could be due to hereditary genes , individual 's family , offspring , and offspring of the family members might also inherit the disease .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the

As the genetic testing is making rapid progress on providing information on the hidden DNAs which might cause diseases , the techniques have also aroused a large amount of heated debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the control of final say of the testing .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
First of all , individual has the right to determine whether or not it is necessary to make the genetic testing results public .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the

Similar to the problem of adult children , although the number of aging population keeps rising , the amount of old people who could get chance to work either full time or part time tends to fall due to economic and social changes that less employers want to hire old labor - from 38 percent of the population 65 and above in 1950 to 25 percent in 2000 and 22 percent in 2010 by the survey from United Nations .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~a	77~77~ArtOrDet~the

The three developments and policies highlighted are examples of the efforts made to help ease the ageing process for the elderly by helping them keep themselves relevant to society and their family .|||28~28~ArtOrDet~the

Basically , it is the moral responsibility of our society to do all its best to support the elderly even at the expense of other areas of the country 's development .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
There is no denying the fact that each country has its own limited set budget , so it can not afford to spend too much on the elderly because it also has to spend on other areas of the country 's development .|||10~12~ArtOrDet~a

As most elderly stay alone these days and not supported by their families , this scheme would come in handy for them especially when they do not have a stable financial security .|||28~29~ArtOrDet~

Should we limit the public spending on the aged so that the money can be inverted to other areas of the country 's development ?|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
However , in my opinion , the public spending could be more productive if the government knows how to control the money spent on the aged and also how to invest for other areas of development .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	31~32~Prep~in
As the healthcare costs now are getting more and more expensive , consequently , it becomes harder and harder for old poor people to fulfill their payment for the hospitals .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
Based on the situation , some claim that government should automatically spend more and more on the aged , who deserve to be helped .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~this	8~8~ArtOrDet~the
However , the national budget will come under pressure when growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer young persons , which leads to the question that " Can we really afford so much health care for aging population , or are we heading toward a healthcare crisis in the near future ?|||39~39~ArtOrDet~an
Nevertheless , the budget for healthcare is not infinite , so , the government and policy makers must decide at which extent they would give healthcare cost to an individual , depending on his own financial capacity .|||23~24~Vt~will	25~25~ArtOrDet~the	27~28~Prep~of
Researchers and policy makers have made a lot of suggestions and strategies to help buffet the negative impact of aging population on our society .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~an
Therefore , instead of spending too much money on the aged , the government can think about realize some of these planning policies , or other possible policies to solve the problem .|||17~18~Vform~realizing

Moreover , when all of these areas are well invested enough to fulfill all the requirements , the living standard of Singaporeans will increase , consequently , the aged will received more help and budget from the society , or they even earn more money to support themselves too .|||30~31~Vform~receive
In conclusion , Singapore , as well as many Europeans and North American countries , is facing the problem of aging population .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~an
Among these , the increasing number of aged people as well as the decrease in fertility rate as a new way of living is such a challenge that the world has to face in the next decades .|||36~37~Nn~decade
Along with modernized society , the elderly is receiving more and more supports from the government , which is a strategy in social welfare development .|||12~13~Nn~support
Therefore , this spending should be reconsidered carefully to avoid financial shortage on other areas of the country 's development .|||12~13~Prep~in
As part of the effort to enhance the social welfare , a lot of schemes have been adopted and operated in recent years for the sake of the old population .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~

In reality , these below schemes certainly accounted for not a small scale in the increased public spending .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~the	13~14~Prep~of

Secondly , from the social point , it is also the filial obligation of the children to take care of their parents when they get old .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
This will obviously help to reduce the expenditures by sharing the dependency burden between the government and its citizens .|||7~8~Nn~expenditure
The most appropriate reason why the government should limit spending on senior citizens is that it will constrain other fields from taking advantage of government budget .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the

Compared with the rise in health and community development , youth , sports expenditure as mentioned below , the public investment in such a strategic scheme like education in Singapore between 2005 and 2008 has a tendency to decrease from 994 to 856 million dollars ( nearly 14 % ) ( 2 ) .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~	38~39~Vt~decreased

Some might disagree that even though they can not compete with the younger generation for jobs , the government does organize job fairs to help elderly seek jobs .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
However , although these job fairs provide more working opportunities for the elderly , the success of such job fairs is largely dependent on the receptiveness of the elderly 's expectations to the new job scope .|||31~32~Prep~of

One considerable implication of aging population is its possible impact on the country 's future macro-economic performance ( Schuiz , Borowoki , & Crown , 1991 ) .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~an

In a nutshell , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas of the country 's development do not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the aged .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
One should note that setting limits on the public spending on the aged is to reduce the over-dependency of the aged on the government while diverting resources to other areas of development is to allow the country to prosper and sequentially benefit the whole community , which includes the aged .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~

Another example will be the Medical Endowment Fund ( Ministry of Health [ MOH ] , 2007 ) , which are known as Medifund and Medifund Silver , whereby elderly are given provision of medical funds due to not having a Medisave or Medishield Account , or who did not accumulate enough in these accounts , or have no immediate family member to pay their hospital bills .|||2~4~Vt~is	33~34~Prep~for

Aging process can be eased by increasing birth rates , increased workforce productivity and reduce the physical and psychological aspects of aging .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The aging
Currently , governments have helped to ease the aging process in terms of the country 's economic development , social aspects and technological developments .|||23~24~Nn~development
Firstly , aging population greatly threatens the country 's economic development because with more elderly retiring , the workforce productivity falls sharply .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~an	6~7~ArtOrDet~a

( Kunz , 2007 ) Another method to increase the workforce productivity is to invite foreign talents and immigrants to stay and work , in order to counter the low birth rate of the country .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	33~34~ArtOrDet~a
For instance , in Australia , there is a rise of hate crimes against the immigrants .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
Even so , employers should hire their employees based on their capability and not nationality in order to avoid such crimes and through this policy , it will increase the country 's competiveness , which will increase the country 's workforce productivity and boost the economy .|||29~30~ArtOrDet~a
However , others may disagree that these actions are not effective because educating the young does take a long time especially when the aging problems are pressing at the moment .|||22~23~ArtOrDet~
It is true that the fruits of education take years to harvest , however according to statistics given , the national volunteerism rate in Singapore has risen from 15.2 to 15.5 in 2006 , this does shows that more people are concerned about the elderly .|||36~37~Vform~show
However , through education not only the youths will be more accepting of the elderly but also , in the future they will most likely not to practise ageism in workplace and this thinking will be ingrained in the society thus generating positive outcomes .|||30~30~ArtOrDet~the

Nowadays , " ills of old age " is no longer a topic that " only poets and philosophers " would interest in .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~the	21~22~Vt~be interested
Although problems related to aging population become increasingly severe , with more important priority , governments should limit the spending on aging population .|||6~6~Vform~have	21~21~ArtOrDet~the
This is because of three reasons : an increasing spending in dealing with problems in regard to aging population would probably affect other objectives with higher priority ; government can not solve the " ills of old age " alone ; and the cost of " unlimit " the spending on aging population can not justify the benefits in the long run .|||14~15~Prep~with	17~17~ArtOrDet~an	28~29~ArtOrDet~the
Firstly , with limited budget , unlimited government spending on aging population would severely affect the economic developmentat first priority of most governments ' objectives .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~a
Since the tax is the main resource of governments ' revenue , and the tax base could hardly be increased in short run , overspending limited budget on retirement welfare for the time being means less investing in improving infrastructure , and developing advanced technology , which could greatly accelerate economic development in the long run .|||2~3~Nn~taxes	21~21~ArtOrDet~the	25~25~ArtOrDet~a/ the
In that case , governments would have less financial flexibility due to the relatively smaller scale of economy with less tax revenue generated by limited scale of workforce .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the
In real life , the shrinking workforce caused by aging population has contributed to a significant decline in real GDP in some developed countries such as French and Germany .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~an
This means that the capacity that these governments have to support aging population in the long run would eventually be weakened due to a lower budget .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~an
Secondly , the answer to the problem with regard to aging population should be the cooperation between the elders themselves and the government , not simply by given priority in terms of unlimited government spending .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~an	27~27~ArtOrDet~a
For example , government could help in training elders and engaging them with more jobs .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
By doing so , government spending on aging population could be effectively reduced .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~an
Meanwhile , governments could invest more money in economic development , which is at governments ' first priority , and generate more revenue to support the aging population in the future though a larger scale of economy instead of an unlimited percentage increase in government spending .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~the
The problem in regard to aging population would eventually be eased through more financial support generated from a larger scale of economy instead of increasing percentage cost of budget and participation of the elders themselves .|||2~3~Prep~with	5~5~ArtOrDet~an	25~25~ArtOrDet~the	28~28~ArtOrDet~the

If the population of aging group is still expanding , the national budget will soon be drained up by supporting the old aged group with welfare treatment .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the

In Singapore , the existing policy on employing the elderly does not do enough to allow senior worker to continue playing their roles in working community .|||17~18~Nn~workers
The HDB housing policy which encourages families to stay closer to their parents allows elderly to continue their role in helping their children or even an additional role as a grandparent .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the

In order to rectify the homeward bound predicament , not only more elderly friendly facilities have to be constructed , but the critical care medical treatment and surgery is chiefly required too .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
Various medical institutions should offer trainings and preparations to medical professional personnel to equip them with the necessity to countenance the upcoming crisis .|||5~6~Nn~training	7~8~Vt~preparation
Public spending should therefore be more focus on providing excellent healthcare facilities and services which would benefits and eases the growing health crisis amidst the aging population .|||6~7~Vform~focused	16~17~Vform~benefit	18~19~Vform~ease
Such a problem like this could not be solved overnight , but need to have a suitable long-term plan .|||5~6~Vt~can	12~13~Vt~needs
Although there are still arguments surrounding old age issues , it can be believed that much have been done to ease the aging process , particularly medical advancement and efficient social policies .|||16~17~Vt~has
In the Singapore context , there are some hospitals will be built such as Jurong General Hospital opened in 2015 , and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun is under-constructed and will be opened in 2010 .|||17~18~Vform~opening	33~34~Vform~opening
Furthermore , on the understanding that elder people need a longer time to recover , the Ministry of Health has launched a new model to set up a link between acute hospitals with community ones where patients can receive relevant care after discharged from the acute hospitals .|||42~42~Vform~being
In fact , there are some older people having no child or being single , so it is more difficult for them in their old days .|||12~13~Vform~are
Although governments raise fund and increase budget to support the elderly , healthcare costs is still high and some of the treatments which apply new technologies and methods are so expensive that money they save will run out after a few days .|||3~4~Nn~funds	6~7~Nn~budgets
Solving these problems is not an easy task and can not achieve in a short-run as well .|||11~12~Vform~be achieved	13~14~ArtOrDet~the
Many argue that limiting public spending on the elderly would only leave individuals and their families to face issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .|||18~18~Prep~with
On the contrary , diverting public spending on other areas of the country 's development will expand its economic opportunities and improve social conditions .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the

This may lead to people who are in urgent need for medical consultation to be delayed which in turn , may cause serious consequences .|||13~15~Vt~being
Financial help should be given to those really in the need , instead of allocating large amount of funds to all the elderly .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
More elderly friendly facilities along neighbourhood should be built and good values such as giving up seats to the elderly should be taught to the public to help the elderly get along with their daily lives .|||4~5~Prep~in
Like in Singapore , there are priority seats for elderly so that they do not have to stand for long distances .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
More resources should be allocated to develop the country 's education system so as to ensure the continuous supply of good labour and also to educate the public the importance of self-reliance .|||28~28~Prep~of
In conclusion , for a country to be successful , it not only has to look after the well-beings , in this case , the elderly , but also to ensure the continuous development of the country in the economy , education and technology sectors .|||41~41~ArtOrDet~the
Each people have his or her own opinions .|||1~2~Nn~person
Some people say that the country 's budget should focus on healthcare for the elders , as old , retired people are hard to cope with their problems without any supports of the governments .|||30~31~Nn~support	31~32~Prep~from
In my own opinion , I agree with the latter , for these following reasons .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~the
Firstly , national budget should be spent on more essential areas of the country 's development .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Investing in education , in my opinion , is the key to growth of any country .|||13~14~Prep~in

Secondly , the money of the country should also be used in improving health care .|||11~13~Vform~to improve
More hospitals with better equipments should be built .|||4~5~Nn~equipment
In fact , this is also a way to solve the heavy burden of aging process , because the elders are who need the supports of health care the most .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
The development of technology and its effects has always been one of the most important factors that totally change the way we lived from the past .|||18~19~Vt~changed	22~22~Vt~have

An aging population have many social , economic and health implications to a country and this common occurrence is not just a short term resultant but a long term problem caused by the falling of fertility rates and high mortality .|||11~12~Prep~for
Aging of a population has become such a natural process that is happening among most of the developing countries and Singapore is not being spared too .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~the aging	13~14~Prep~in
In fact , Singapore is one of the fastest aging populations in Asia and therefore , there is a need for the government to develop and implement new public policies to accommodate to this newly emerging group of people in the near future .|||4~5~Vform~has
This has come about due to the improved in medical technology , public health awareness and sanitation , which actually shows that many Singaporeans are living better than they had before .|||20~21~Vt~showed
Because this group of people will generally make up a significant amount in our population , government should divert more funds to improve on its healthcare system and also upgrade our infrastructure and facilities to cater to an older population .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the	23~24~Prep~
In fact , our local government is already preparing Singapore to a new paradigm of aging as can be seen from the funding of projects such as the building of Studio Apartments , which is specially built to cater to the needs of the aged .|||10~11~Prep~for
In addition , public spending should not be limited as more funds should be dedicated to improve the healthcare systems by building more nursing homes and also hospitals for the aged as old age will usually be an age that is more prone to illnesses and diseases .|||16~17~Vform~improving
Singapore is never a welfare state to begin with ; the government has adopted policy to ensure self-reliance such as the introduction of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) which makes it compulsory for all Singapore citizens to save for future use .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~a	23~23~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , it is impossible for our government to provide welfare and pension for everyone , thus the Medisave Scheme under Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) was introduced which make it compulsory for all Singaporeans to set aside 6-8 % of their salary to put into their personal account that can be used to pay for hospital fees .|||43~44~Nn~salaries
However , over focusing on this situation may inhibit the growth of our economy as these precious funds can be diverted to other uses especially in the area of development .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
I feel that public spending on the aged should be given more attention and more funds , as for the long-term , the aging population could potentially become a major problem .|||18~19~Prep~in
If the incentives work , there will be more youths in the future , this will help to ease the financial burden of the elderly .|||3~4~Vt~worked
If the TFR is higher , there would also be more people to work in the future , contributing more to the economy and sustaining its high growth .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~at
The lower number of working people would mean that the elderly would be more dependent on fewer people , these people would be heavily burdened .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~
This would be good for the economy in the future , and would also result in more people to support the elderly .|||18~20~Vform~supporting
Therefore , public spending should not emphasize only social , but also economic development of the country .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Without the government 's initiatives , the elderly people are going to go through a hard time coping in the society .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~
( IRAS , 2009 ) It serves as a winning tool as the employers get to bring their businesses to a higher level , and the existing workers in turn retain their jobs .|||25~26~ArtOrDet~
Secondly , education and learning are important factors attributing to one country 's success .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~a
With better jobs and increase in income , they can help the families in coping with the high standards of living and spiraling healthcare costs for the aged .|||4~5~Nn~increases	13~15~Vform~to cope
The government can also hold " Healthy Lifestyle " campaigns to encourage the aged to engage more actively , and promote healthy aging .|||18~18~Vt~in activities
Although the help is theoretically superficial , it is indirectly helping the society to deal with the ageing society more effectively than using the monetary support , which is a temporary solution .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~as compared to	23~24~ArtOrDet~
If we do not pay attention to the long term effects the problem is going to cause , we will risk the possibility of allocating the limited resources for the wrong usage .|||25~26~ArtOrDet~
It is well-known that there are various areas of country 's development which demand substantial expenditure from public spending such as urban development , infrastructure projects , biomedical research , edbiz , and so on .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~a
Therefore , the public spending on the aged should not be limited so that it guarantees the welfare of the aged and protects their rights and benefits .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
If the public spending on the aged is limited , the burden on the children or younger generation will be much heavier since they have to bear more expenses of their parents .|||24~24~Vt~will

From my perspective , economic development is not only the key factor easing the aging but also is the key solution for some serious problems caused by this process .|||12~12~Prep~in	21~22~Prep~to

Increasing investment of capitals in amenities such as day care centres , elderly friendly housings and facilities , establishing more homes for the elderly etc should be carried out in response to the ageing population .|||3~4~Nn~capital
Despite the increase in capital investments on elderly friendly amenities , the allocated budget for country 's development need not be jeopardized .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~a
Instead governments could undergo reallocation of budget whereby more funds initially set aside for childcare amenities be transferred to fund the development of elderly friendly amenities since the precede needs fewer resources due to low birth rate in the population .|||34~34~ArtOrDet~the
More policy making attentions and resources hence could be placed on other aspects in the country 's development as a result .|||13~14~Prep~of
Increased public spending in this case encourages senior citizens to stay idle , when the resources can be better diverted to other areas of country 's development .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the

Undoubtedly , the spending on the aged is essential as they have contributed to our society greatly , but this should only be done to an extent and shall not be the full responsibility of the government .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~

According to the Friedland and Summer ( 2005 ) , if a nation spend more on the aged , besides slowing down the growth of the nation , it will also create more costly problems in future .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
These problems include insufficient housing for the people , higher unemployment rate and insufficient budget for the future aged population may occur .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Nn~rates

In conclusion , public spending should be limited to an extent where no single needy is deprived from the assistance .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
The government should also diversify the funds to develop the economy , so when economy grown , means there will be more money for the government to support those aged who are unfortunate and vulnerable .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	14~14~ArtOrDet~the	15~16~Vform~grows

The speed of aging process around the world is being hastened due to the high life expectancy and low fertility rate .|||2~3~Prep~in	20~21~Nn~rates

Nonetheless , these costs incurred during the recession will only be about 10 % of the spending related to elders care in the long-term period from now to 2050.Compared to the influence brought by financial crisis , it is critical for a country to divert more resources from the age-related spending to pump up the dire economy .|||19~20~Nn~elder	34~34~ArtOrDet~the	48~49~ArtOrDet~
Although many rich countries have accepted that it is time to reform their policies , the transformation is progressing only timidly due to reluctance of introducing unpopular measures affected by political factors like election .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
The country should not focus much of their effort to explore the incentives for spending in the elderly care , instead , they should set an adequate plan for the sectors which are equally important to the country 's development .|||15~16~Prep~on	16~17~ArtOrDet~

On the contrary , the alternative to support the help elders lead a better life is not only limited on a large spending budget , it is also achievable while the country boosts the economy through different incentives , like supporting the entrepreneurship of people by cutting tax and giving allowance .|||9~10~Vform~helping	10~11~ArtOrDet~the elderly	19~20~Prep~to	47~48~Nn~taxes	50~51~Nn~allowances

It is a challenging task for the government to persuade people to agree over such adjustment .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~an
In a nutshell , a solid development of a country is built on a healthy look of the financial position and an unbiased development plan .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~the
Having a superior elderly care system does not mean having a great success in governing a country .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
On top of that , spending should not be narrowly limited on the age-related spending only , but to allocate the resources justly over all the sectors instead of overlooking their importance .|||11~12~Prep~to	12~13~ArtOrDet~

I believe that spending on the education is one of the more important areas where public money should be spent on .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
For example , increasing the mandatory schooling for Singaporean to secondary school and providing more funding for student from poorer background .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~	8~9~Nn~Singaporeans	17~18~Nn~students

In conclusion , by spending more on both economy and education , we will be able to decrease effects of the aging problem .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	18~18~ArtOrDet~the

Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~a

By three methods that tackles the problem in a long run .|||4~5~Vform~can tackle	8~9~ArtOrDet~the
Firstly , by channeling the money saved to making a more robust educational system , the government can have better civics and moral education .|||8~9~Vform~make
The new comprehensive education system should include firm beliefs that one should take care of their parents when they 're old , instilling a filial piety mind-set .|||23~24~ArtOrDet~
Thus , by having a superb educational system , the government can essentially worry less on meeting the needs of lowly-educated population , tackling the affordability issue .|||15~16~Prep~about
By spending on the development of public amenities like beaches , larger parks , family-oriented shopping malls , etc. , family can get to foster better relationship amongst them .|||26~27~Nn~relationships
With better understanding , I believe the child of elderly parents will feel more obliged to compromise their time and money to provide better care and concern for them .|||8~9~Prep~with
Thirdly , there should be an increase in fund on the healthcare sector .|||9~10~Prep~for
One primary concern for providing healthcare for the aged is the cost .|||3~4~Prep~in
Although some might argue that increasing the fund just targets at providing for the aged , by looking at the bigger picture , the improved healthcare system provides for all .|||23~24~ArtOrDet~an
This was done in view that the aged actually cherish the quality rather than the quantity of life , similar to the direction of hospice care in providing comfort rather than cure .|||1~2~Vt~has been
But despite the revision of spending in this area , they must thread the issue with care as there are doubts over the sustainability over the provision of this free service .|||24~25~Prep~of
Interestingly , aid for the aged in their psycho-social needs is still lacking .|||6~7~Prep~for
In conclusion , it is noted that capping of public spending to the aged will provide more cash flow to other sectors , which will in turn reduce and tackle the problems faced now .|||11~12~Prep~for
It is quite a pity to limit the public spending on the elderly regarding some of the disadvantages that are brought by such policy .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
However , if we limit the public spending on the aged , the money can be diverted and used to develop the country in other areas , such as economy and education , which will eventually lead to a more advantages for the country .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	38~39~Nn~

In summary , having a limit to the budget will eventually have long-term implications to the country 's process and growth .|||14~15~Prep~for
Instead of treating the elderly in society as an expense , the government can think of ways to harness the knowledge and experience from them so that they can contribute back more into society .|||32~33~Prep~to

Governments around the world have been actively seeking measures to cope with the problem , one of which is to increase the public spending on the aged .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
Even though public spending on the elderly is essential for a country to deal with an ageing population , it should be limited because of the underlying negative implications .|||25~26~ArtOrDet~

With greater expenditure into helping the aged , the country will possess fewer funds for development in other areas such as infrastructure .|||3~4~Prep~on
Therefore , with an inadequate input into these areas , the development of the latter will be neglected .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
As such areas are the key pillars to a country 's development , any slowdown in these areas will affect the country 's regional competitiveness .|||7~8~Prep~of
Though many may claim that the bulk of the amount needed to support the aged should come from the government who has the greatest financial power in supporting them , however , this public spending should be limited .|||26~27~Prep~to	27~28~Vform~support

There always have been numerous on-going researches , development or policies to help the easing of the process of aging .|||6~7~Nn~research
There will be three reasons to be elaborated in the following paragraphs .|||1~3~Vt~are
Firstly , the mobility for the elderly has been improved .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~

Another initiative is the Lifelong Income For the Elderly under the Central Provident Funds Scheme ( CFP LIFE ) , whereby there is a fixed amount of income for elderly who is aged 65 years old and above .|||29~29~ArtOrDet~an
With regards to this , the Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr Lee Hsien Loong had reassured the public that the government will continue to revise the initiatives to make sure that the elderly can work longer with ease .|||1~2~Nn~regard	15~16~Vform~has
With regards to the ability of the companies to cope with re-employment of older workers , the government has introduced another program know as the ADVANTAGE !|||1~2~Nn~regard
No doubt on the other hand , people criticized about the negative impacts of such procedures and the attitude of people who engaged such procedures .|||9~10~Prep~	23~23~Prep~in
They emphasize on the side effects such as the addiction to Botox injections and they often think otherwise for the attitude of this group of elderly .|||2~3~Prep~	18~19~Prep~of
This is actually up to how the individual want to age and their way to deal with the process of aging .|||15~16~Vform~dealing
This is as long as they had fully considered the negative impacts of such procedures and agreed to accept them without condition .|||6~7~Vform~have
As an outsider , we should keep an objective outlook on this issue and we can not impede them from what they deem is the best for themselves .|||15~16~Vform~

Further emphasis by governments with regards to public architecture has also made aging easier .|||5~6~Nn~regard
This can be attributed to greater awareness by technological companies in the needs of an elderly individual , thus attributing greater emphasis in this field of research .|||10~11~Prep~of	22~23~Prep~to

Nowadays almost every developed country is concerned about the issue of growing aging population because this issue is a barrier for a country 's development .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~a
Aging population is the result of the increase in the expectancy rate over several centuries and continues to increase because of advancements in medication .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~an

Due to the aging population there is a shrinking workforce , so government should spend more on education so that it will increase the productivity of the workforce .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Spending on education will give better return to a country in near future because education is a major factor for the country 's economic growth whereas the spending on aged is just the opposite which is spending on the aged is inversely proportional to economic growth .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~	29~29~ArtOrDet~the

Most probably for a country opportunity cost for spending in defense and infrastructure is more than the spending on the aged ones because spending in infrastructure generates revenue for a country like attracting foreign investments and tourisms , spending on defense give 's a sense of security to a nation whereas spending on aged is just an expenditure for a country , and for a country to pay its expenditures it should have sufficient amount of revenues .|||53~53~ArtOrDet~the
Spending on the infrastructure and defense will enhance the country 's economic growth rate , living standards and overall the image of a country .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the

So therefore spending on aged ones should be limited so that money can be spend to other areas of the country 's development .|||15~16~Prep~on
Since from past several decades there is been an increase in the expectancy rate which had probably caused the aging problem , so there should be a sufficient increase in the spending on the aged which will eventually improve the living standard of the aged population and thus will contribute to the country 's development .|||1~2~Prep~	2~2~ArtOrDet~the	6~7~Vt~has	26~27~ArtOrDet~

This problem not only happens in UK since people tend to lose motivation in working or saving once they have enough pension to spend .|||13~15~Vform~to work	16~17~Vform~save
Moreover , too much pension may even lead to pension abuse which will make the public spending ineffective .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
Despite of the above two reasons , some people still argue that public should help the elderly as much as possible since they have once contributed to the society .|||1~2~Prep~	12~12~ArtOrDet~the

Under such circumstance , government should make a more effective spending scheme to solve the aging problem rather than without any plan or restriction .|||2~3~Nn~circumstances	4~4~ArtOrDet~the
To sum up , it is necessary for government to limit the spending on the elderly so that the economy of the country can be developed more quickly and the effectiveness of the public pensions can be increased .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the

Faced with this situation , governments and policy makers around the world have been providing solutions such as the introduction of economic policies , social policies , and architectural designs which benefit both elderly and the society .|||33~33~ArtOrDet~the	35~36~ArtOrDet~
One of the main solutions offered would be the economic policy that eases the financial situation of the elderly .|||5~5~Vt~to be	6~8~Vt~is
One of the evident examples would be the health care subsidy which has been carried out by many developed countries such as Singapore , Japan , and the U.S. Others may object that too much are being spent on the elderly and this will hinder the growth of the country which is fundamentally more essential .|||35~36~Vt~is
However , this argument may not be valid because elderly is considered as an integral part of a country that can not be totally excluded .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the	10~11~Vt~are
With the right economic plan and policies , elderly can effectively contribute back to the growth of the country .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
As mentioned by Singapore prime minster Lee ( The Journal , 2009 ) , " aging should be redefined as an opportunity rather than burden to the society " .|||4~6~Nn~Prime Minister

However , the current economic situation and the decreasing fertility rate have left the young adults , who have no siblings to share costs , with no choice but to give up on their parents .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~

With this in mind , countries start to provide elder friendly architectural design to assist elderly in their daily activities as the aging population increases from time to time .|||6~7~Vt~have begun

The aging process means as time passes , the people will undergo a process of physical , psychological and social change .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
In order to help the society and people to cope with the changes , current research and development such as new technological inventions and employment schemes are being put in place .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~its

Catering to the upward trend of the aging population , initiated programs such as free health check for the elderly are implemented to encourage these elderly to constantly conduct full body checkup to ensure that they are in good health condition and also advise them on the dos and don'ts in their everyday life so as to maintain a healthy lifestyle .|||24~25~ArtOrDet~the

Aging population is a problem that no country can escape , so what we can do is to reduce this aging process with the help of the research and policies .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~
However , there are limitations in the policies , thus the government can look into alternative methods so that the people will truly benefit from these research and policies .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~

But , on the other hand , companies do save up a lot in their training costs as these employees are more experienced , and retaining them will cut down on the recruitment costs .|||31~32~ArtOrDet~
By working longer , there is more time to ensure that the valuable experience and knowledge are passed on to the younger members of the workforce .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~

In order to deal with these rising issues , government is currently taking active measures to help ease the aging process .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
However , there can only be so much that the government can help in terms of the health care services and policies .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
If these services are not fully utilized by the people and the elderly are not responding to the government assistance , slowly these older people could be considered as not productive and be neglected by the society .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~	17~18~ArtOrDet~

Due to the fact that older patients are more prone to hospital admittances than the other age groups , providing better medical care facilities and services not only helps to reduce the chance of re-admission , it will also facilitate better chances of making a full recovery .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
With less frequent visits to the hospital , the amount of money spent on medical bills would decrease .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
However , to develop the medical sector , huge sum of funds has to be involved which may in turn hamper the development of other sectors .|||9~10~Nn~sums

The first policy development is in medial field .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
Having quality health care services at affordable prices is viewed as one of the most important need for the aging population .|||16~17~Nn~needs

The second policy development is in economic field .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
The first strategy implemented is the setup of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Some of the changes are the increase of CPF minimum sum and the partial withdrawal of the retirement savings upon reaching retirement age .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	16~17~ArtOrDet~
The second strategy implemented is the raise of the retirement age to sixty two years old .|||7~8~Prep~in

The integration of the health care service providers through the medical policies will result in higher quality and more affordable health care system .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	9~10~ArtOrDet~	15~15~ArtOrDet~a
For economic policies , having CPF and raising the retirement age will allow additional wealth accumulation .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	11~13~Vt~allows

Additionally , since there is a breakthrough , the possibility of a cured can not be rule out as well .|||16~17~Vform~ruled
Besides , if more are able to slow down or even prevent themselves from getting the diseases , the aged can lessen their medical cost which will lead to a reduced cost of living .|||16~17~Nn~disease	24~25~Nn~costs
Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confident of aged to face the eventual ageing process .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Similarly , economic policy like Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) also aid in the ageing process of Singaporeans .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
CPF is a saving fund employ by the government .|||5~6~Vform~employed

In the past , a lump sum will be given to the recipients , but now the recipients will get the money in their CPF account on a monthly basis till they pass on .|||7~9~Vt~was
Another plan in CPF known as Medisave , helps the aged to meet healthcare needs and hospitalization fee , so that the aged can afford the usage of healthcare facilities .|||17~18~Nn~fees

Apart from that , advancement in technology also brings about the inventions of new gadgets that have significantly improved the lives of the elderly individuals .|||4~5~Nn~advancements	22~23~ArtOrDet~

Social policies are also implemented to ease the process of aging .|||2~4~Vt~have also been

In conclusion , advancement in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease the process of aging .|||3~4~Nn~advancements
It may be successful in getting children to pay for their dependent parents maintenance but by enforcing such law , but it is a question between achieving ideal economic situation verse morals .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the

And children can only abide to the obligations if they are financially stable .|||5~6~Prep~by
Another strategies in solving ageing population would be to increase the birth .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~Other	4~4~ArtOrDet~the
With increasing population , there is an increase in working population , leading to an increase in income tax and thus solving both problems of shortage of labour force and well as the heavy financial strain placed on the economically active population .|||5~6~Vt~will be
Pro-natalist policy has been implemented since early 1990s yet the effectiveness it has on birth remains questionable .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~A pronatalist	6~6~ArtOrDet~the
Despite much efforts put in by the government in shaping a policy that aims to lessen the financial burden of having children , fertility rates still remain low , as low as 1.08 which is way below replacement rate .|||3~3~Vt~have been
Pro-natalist policy focus mainly on the cash incentives such as baby bonuses of $ 3,00 for the 1st and 2nd child , up to $ 6,000 for the 3rd and 4th child as well as the government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings the parents contribute to their child 's Children Development Account .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The pro-natalist	5~6~ArtOrDet~	35~36~ArtOrDet~
However , in Singapore , the financial burden is less of a concern when we are targeting on the 'productive group ' of the population .|||17~18~Prep~at
In the sense that government actually believes in " Smart people born smart children " , so when they are encouraging population growth they are targeting on the educated ones , who are also the financially stable ones .|||26~27~Prep~at
On the other hand , it can also be argued that raising up a long term process and government 's help in terms of baby bonus and Children development account is temporally , to the age of six .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
Rather than a one policy to cater the whole country , there can be different policies implemented to cater to different income level group .|||7~7~Prep~to

A large amount of development has been done by the government to help ease the process of aging but it is not enough due to the fact that BFA Code only covers new buildings and government developments .|||28~28~ArtOrDet~the

Thereafter , a revised code on Barrier-Free Accessibility In Buildings , a 5-year Barrier-Free Accessibility ( BFA ) Upgrading Program ( 2007-2011 ) was added to support the upgrading of existing buildings .|||23~24~Vt~has been

The focus at the current stage should be setting a strong foundation on the young and the working class rather than spending money on the elderly .|||12~13~Prep~for
Defence is also a major component that we have to place focus in when we talk about the country 's development .|||12~13~Prep~on
However , in this fast paced and ever changing society , the experiences of the aged will get more irrelevant and money will be better used if the public spending on the aged can be diverted into defense to maintain peace so that social and economical aspect of the nation can flourish .|||43~43~ArtOrDet~the
And Singapore , as one of the developed countries having one of the fastest elderly populations in the world , which had around 235,000 elderly population aged 65 year old and above ( or7 % of the population ) in 1999 while this figure being going to reach 796,000 ( or19 % of the population ) by the year 2030 ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) , needs to face this serious challenge and ease the negative impact on society .|||28~29~Nn~years	44~45~Vt~is
The final objective of " Successful Ageing for Singapore " ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) , which has been brought up by Committee on Ageing Issues ( CAI ) established in Dec 2004 and representing from the various sectors in Singapore like the people , private and government , is to ensure that at the individual level , elder Singaporeans should be healthy , active and secure , as well as that all levels of society are well prepared to face an ageing Singapore with challenges and opportunities .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
With approaching this goal , current research and development/ policies , to a large extent , have helped to ease the aging process in different fields , like psychology , medicine , etc. On the other hand , the situation of the fast ageing population in Singapore is still rigorous , even with various research and development/ policies .|||53~53~ArtOrDet~the
However , there is one thing , which should be faced , that although such tend of a fast ageing population is unlikely to be reversed in a short term ; much can still be done to buffer its negative impact on society .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , in order to bring out a brainstorm and change mindsets of elderly , a systematic year-round public education ( PE ) program ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) should be conducted , instead of a week-long activity driven by a citizen-led committee , to infuse a culture of personal responsibility and lifelong planning for old age .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
With launching this PE program , negative attitudes about ageing will be dispelled ; moreover active lifestyles and community involvement among older Singaporeans will be promoted , which follows with strengthening intergenerational bonds , allowing the elder to age with respect and dignity , as well as approaching independent and fulfilling lives as integral members of their families and communities In the area of medicine , a series of efforts has been implemented .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~the launching of

Firstly funds are needed to invest in retraining of workers .|||8~9~Prep~	9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Due to globalization , training of workers is important to develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
The Singapore Budget ( 2009 ) reported that the government will be spending $ 457.7 million of the public fund to subsidise training programmes for working Singaporeans .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
In Singapore , the Ministry of Manpower and Workforce Development Agency had developed a program , which is called Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience , SPUR , in providing training courses at subsidies rate for people to attend .|||11~12~Vt~have
Apart from working population to be re-skilled , the SPUR programme helps retrenched workers to learn new skills so that they can be reemployed and companies are able to send their personnel for training which helps to reduce retrenchments .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
However , there are some older workers whom are unable to attend any courses despite being offered at subsides rate .|||19~20~Nn~rates
Firstly , some older workers have weak command of English or are English illiterate as they are school dropouts .|||13~14~Nn~illiterates

Secondly government expenditure is needed to expand and maintain economic structure .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the

In the Singapore Budget ( 2009 ) , the Ministry of Education is investing $ 7,884 million into subsidising school fees .|||17~18~Prep~in
In conclusion , public spending on the age should be limited so that funds could be used in developing the country through retraining of workers , expanding of economic structure and maintaining a high standard of education in various educational institutions .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~the
Funds being used for country 's development to improve peoples ' life would n't both the young and the old will benefit from it ?|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
Yet , one can not deny the fact that a shortfall in educated people would restrict economic expansion .|||11~12~Prep~of
Thus , it is crucial for countries to invest in the form of education that is desirable for its people to ensure greater economic development .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~a
Through the process of upgrading , individuals are empowered with the relevant skills and knowledge demanded by the job market .|||2~3~Nn~processes
However , funding of training programmes should still proceed as it would increase the productivity and capability of the working population in handling any challenges there might surface in the future .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
For example , Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( 2000 ) stated that 13 million dollars are spent on national security yearly even though it places an immense pressure on the federal budget .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the

In an ageing society , the social aspects not only include the need for appropriate housing schemes but also health care systems for present and future generation of elderly .|||26~27~Nn~generations
An elderly-friendly built environment is a key principle to which an elderly can adjust and integrate themselves into the community .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~the elderly
Hence , with these schemes , it is proven that elderly in Singapore are given top priority in the community .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
Needless to say , the nation would have problem to support the increasing spending on the elderly in a bearish economy .|||8~9~Nn~problems
Thus it is important for the nation to divert our public spending to with the aim of improve the economy .|||17~18~Vform~improving
Just like elderly is an important asset to a nation , children is an also important asset .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
The nation can benefit the younger generation by diverting its fund on other areas .|||3~4~Vform~help

The three reasons provided explained why public funds on elderly should be limited and divert to other areas of development .|||4~5~Vt~explain	14~15~Vt~diverted
With regard to the problems , many countries focus much attention on it by introducing policies or by giving out funds in order to reduce the problems cause by the ageing population .|||27~28~Vt~caused
However , it would be better if the expenses used on the aged should be limited so that there will be sufficient funds available for other areas of the country 's development .|||13~15~Vt~is
This may result in greater productivity among the workers as they tend to be more committed for their work ( Valarie Tan , 2009 ) .|||16~17~Prep~to
Government may also spend the amount in development where it can attract foreign talents to the country to solve the problems of manpower shortage .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The
In addition , it is the responsibilities of the elderly as well as the working people to plan financially for their future ( Peter G. Peterson , 2001 ) .|||6~7~Nn~responsibility
During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead in advance for their future on the likely cost incurred for health care services .|||24~25~Nn~costs
In order to solve this problem , the government have implemented certain policies to aids the aged , some of the policies are the introduction of the Central Provident Funds , tax reliefs and the Public Housing scheme .|||14~15~Vt~aid
For example , the MediShield are used to better prepare them for the future medical costs ( Central Provident Fund Board , 2009 ) .The implementation of these policies will hence reduce the burden on the aged and thus reduce the public spending required on them .|||40~41~ArtOrDet~	44~45~Prep~for
Therefore more attentions need to be given to the aged .|||3~4~Vt~is needed
A better way is to evaluate critically on the level of importance of the different areas and balance the public funds according to priority .|||7~8~Prep~
" Our baby boomers will join the ranks of 'elderly ' in a few years .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Thus , generally , future groups of aged may be better off and can still depend on themselves if they were to make use of their intellectual assets .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Limiting public spending on the aged should be done so for the favours of other areas of the country 's development .|||12~13~Vt~favour	13~14~Prep~
We need to recognize that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of country 's development to attain higher efficiency and to have better allocation of resources .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
One example is by transferring the money that we can use solely on the aged to other field of country 's development like improvement in infrastructure .|||17~18~Nn~fields	19~19~ArtOrDet~the
This will benefit the whole population including the aged through providing a more diverse and well-developed system in transport , like the construction of the new circle lines in Singapore .|||9~10~Prep~by
Therefore , one way to counter this problem is through diverting the money to other field of country 's development like education .|||9~10~Prep~by	15~17~Nn~fields	17~17~ArtOrDet~the
Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of country 's development .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the

These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generation and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .|||11~12~Nn~generations
Global aging is a critical topic that the world has been concerned about .|||9~11~Vt~is
While the government focuses its expenditure on improving healthcare products and treatments , it is also important that elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
For example in Singapore , the government introduce a 2 years wellness programme that aims to encourage healthy lifestyle by catering the physical , social and emotional needs of seniors through health screenings , social services , exercises , eldercare and social networking sessions ( Lim , 2009 ) .|||7~8~Vt~introduced
By maintaining a socially active lifestyle , elderly are more resistance to health problems as they are able to keep both their mind and body active and healthy .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Encouraging elderly to support themselves in their old age by extending their working life helps to reduce elder dependency ( Peterson , 2001 ) .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
In complement with its re-employment legislation , the government has also enacted other legislations and initiatives for instance the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers and Advantage !|||0~1~Prep~To	2~3~Prep~

Policymakers have also step up efforts in reducing the financial burden of an aging population by providing financial aids and encouraging people to save in advance for their retirement .|||3~4~Vt~stepped

Thus , if the government chooses to reduce public spending on them , social issues such as elderly suicide rate may rise .|||19~20~Nn~rates
Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should have planned the national budget carefully and have allocated desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .|||15~17~Vt~allocate
Therefore , government 's expenditure on the elderly should not be restricted just because other areas of development of the country are assumed to be more important .|||2~4~ArtOrDet~the	14~14~ArtOrDet~the
( CPF , 2009 ) Furthermore , to increase the nation 's birth rate , Singapore government has enhanced benefits offered in the Marriage and Parenthood Package , which includes higher Parenthood Tax Rebate extended to Singaporeans with more children , but capped at $ 20,000 per child .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	16~16~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , Singapore government has played a huge part in easing the ageing population .|||11~12~Vform~managing
Public spending is the expenditure by government which includes health , education , military and development projects .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
The public spending should be used in other areas of the country 's development like shopping malls , Integrated Resort , restaurants , hotels , museums , theatres , and theme parks .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
The aim is to increase tourism industry and attract foreigners to spend more money .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the

If the public spending on the aged is not limited , people will tend to depend on the governments more .|||18~19~Nn~government

In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social statuses .|||26~27~Vt~status

Initially , increasing the certain age of retirement would alleviate the burden of aging population .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~an
Secondly , the attempt to raise the fertility rates could also be one the possible solutions .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
In fact , this solution somehow could ensure the economy that it would be sufficient new generation of workforce to provide for the labour market when it comes to the time for the previous generation to get retired .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~a

As aforementioned above , in the mean time for the next new generation of workforce , the government can consider employing immigrants for a short period of 10 or 20 years .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
To solve the problem , a new standard of skills for immigrants should be established or the government should have the immigrant workers re-trained for the country 's purposes although it might take time and quite lots of money .|||36~37~ArtOrDet~a lot
In conclusion , the problem of aging population is rather a problem of rigid and outmoded policies and institutions than only a problem of a demographic change .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~an

We usually hear Singaporeans complaining about stress , primarily from work or from education system .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore , finally , government may need to spend a large amount of money on creating incentives for companies to hire old people , namely : tax reduction , subsidy for each elder employed , etc .|||4~5~Nn~governments
Despite of these economic constraints , there is still an urgent need for the government to increase the amount of children per household to replace the huge retiring labor force in order to maintain the economic growth within a country .|||1~2~Prep~

Policy to introduce retirement scheme is also believed to be one of the factors in easing aging process .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the
Take Singapore as an example , the government make it compulsory that every working adults must contribute a certain percentage of their monthly income into their individual CPF ( Central Provident Fund ) account in preparation for retirement .|||8~9~Vt~has made
This retirement scheme helps to reduce pressure on the economy as it allows the elderly to have a considerable sum of money in future to support themselves .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
In summary , Social policies such as increasing in retirement age might result in lesser dependency on the younger generation while lowering the barrier of work age immigrants will decrease the median age of the population and lastly , the introduction of retirement scheme can allow people to save for their retirement .|||42~42~ArtOrDet~a

But nonetheless , countries that are already dealing with the problem of aging population had identified the limitations of the policies that are implemented .|||14~15~Vt~have
And if this problem persists , it will gradually become a roadblock for the future advancement of a society .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
The approaches that countries usually adopt to solve the aging issue include the prolonging of working lives of the elderly and the provision of an array of welfare pension schemes for them .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the
In consequence , the government have to provide funding for these companies to encourage them to retain their elderly workers .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
But this move is viable as the vast knowledge and experiences that these elderly had gained over the years of working in the company serves as excellent mentors for the younger generations .|||10~11~Nn~experience	14~15~Vt~have
This will in turn generate more economical benefits for the companies .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~

However , considering the future financial inputs that these well-equipped workforces would generate , it would prove that it is a worthwhile investment for the country .|||6~7~Nn~input	15~17~Vt~proves
Being flexible to the limitations of funds and not rigidly capping the maximum spending , will allow more room for greater variations of solutions to be carried out .|||2~3~Prep~about

To countries with old population , medical science needs to be considered , and invested more in so that we will have more and better ways of easing the aging process .|||4~5~Nn~populations
Furthermore , medical science is one of the effective solutions for aging process , which help ease the economic burden for the country by reducing the money for elder 's welfare , diverting it to other areas of the country 's development .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Firstly , greater productivity should be encouraged with the younger generation to be cost-efficient and productive .|||11~13~Vform~being
Therefore , the aging population is not an insurmountable problem , funds could be sub-divided for the expenditure in other sectors such as education , tourism and Research and Development ( R&D ) .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
Funds are constantly pumped into the education system for the financing of students and also for constant improvements of the education system .|||18~19~Prep~in
For example , in February 2009 , the Singapore Tourism Board announced that an incentive of $ 90 million has been provided for the BOOST ( Building On Opportunities to Strengthen Tourism ) which is targeted at aiding the tourism sector in times of challenges ( Singapore Tourism Board , 2009 ) .|||41~42~Prep~during

On the whole , the aging population is not insurmountable problem .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~an
Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and the R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .|||23~24~ArtOrDet~
In turn , with more revenue being generated , more benefits and financial aids could be provided to the aged which benefits the country as a whole .|||13~14~Nn~aid
Aging population is a global issue nowadays , especially in the developed countries .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
This will soon affect the Asian countries with more serious impacts .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~
Hence , this has exerted more pressure on the society , which could lead to problems such as low social security , economic depression and inadequate education .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
Hence , it is essential to limit the public spending on the elderly , so more money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
As healthcare services gradually increase , the public spending on the aged would also increase .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
To maintain the healthcare system for the elderly , a significant amount of money will have to be spent on , which leads to serious consequences on the society .|||26~27~Prep~for	27~28~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , the government should adjust the spending on healthcare to an appropriate level .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
Setting limits on the spending on the aged would raise indignation among the elderly , especially people without a savings , poor single women , and the illiterate .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	18~19~ArtOrDet~
Some may say it is inhumane when limiting the spending on the aged .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
However , policy makers should always look at the interest of the whole country rather than just focusing on particular one area .|||9~10~Nn~interests
The reduced spending on the aged can then be invested in other areas for instance education .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~

One of the issues if the public spending is limited is that it will impose financial hardship on the elderly , especially for elderly women .|||8~9~Vt~were
However , the limited public spending also have some side effects to the country , such as the overall wealth of the country will be imbalanced .|||11~12~Prep~on
Thus , instead of limiting the public spending on the aged , government should look for other possible solution .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	12~12~ArtOrDet~the	18~19~Nn~solutions

However , it is when people can prolong their life-span that governments need to pay attention to another difficulty - the social influences of the aging population .|||24~25~ArtOrDet~an
Despite the fact that many people approve the idea of unlimited budget for the old , it would be better to set a term to governments ' expenses in this problem for some reasons .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
When getting older and older , generally , people can not contribute to the development of their countries as much as the young do and it is the younger generation that will assume responsibility of consolidating the country 's powers as well as enhancing the nation 's status in the world .|||33~33~ArtOrDet~the	33~34~Nn~responsibilities
At this point , one may wonder that the old people did contribute to the improvements of their countries in the past , consequently , they deserve the government 's regard at their old age and if the governments ignore this problem , the next generations may not be willing to devote their ability to those who will make their contributions oblivious .|||30~31~Vt~care	39~40~Vt~ignored
It should , however , be emphasized that the governments do pay attention to the aged population and what mentioned here is limiting the spending on this matter in a reasonable way .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
The article Help the aged ( 2009 ) stressing that " the budget must not forget older people " even when governments are in difficult financial situation one more time provides evidence to confirm this argument .|||8~9~Vt~stresses
In other words , governments highly appreciate the contribution of old people in the past and try to offer them more but the budget constraint calls for limiting in order to develop other aspects of society .|||8~9~Nn~contributions

As a result , the ever-growing of older people 's dependence on the governments may lead to unexpected problems thereafter such as overspending on this matter and lack of budget to invest in other fields to develop countries .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~	27~27~ArtOrDet~a
The Strategy for Older People ( Welsh Assembly Government , 2003 ) also approved that the spending for the old should be limited so that the budget can be balanced for many issues of a nation and it is considered as the strategy for long-term development of every country .|||41~42~ArtOrDet~a	44~44~ArtOrDet~the

It is , however , maybe approached from another angle that a constant proportion of GDP of a country to support the old people is maintained .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the
In this case , when governments have budget to invest in other areas of the countries ' development , the economy operates well , the overall income of a country escalates ; the spending for old people will be put up as a result .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , as for overall social influences , there should be a reasonable limitation in terms of spending for the old people so that the governments can balance their expenses for various problems of their countries .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~the spendingpending	20~21~ArtOrDet~

The country 's social stability will inevitably be disrupted if such policy is applied forcibly without any consent from the elderly .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~a
Another argument advocating the limitation on budget for the old is that it is better to increase the wealth of the country by investing on the younger generation , which will be the future workforce of the country , and temporarily spend less on the elderly , who left , or will sooner or later leave the workforce .|||24~25~Prep~in	48~48~Vt~have
However , in times of difficulties , old people have no one but their families and relatives to rely on , and we are back in the situation we discussed above .|||29~29~Vt~have

In another separate study by ( Chu &Yuen , 2008 ) , it is stated that around 67 % of the respondent think that the compulsory saving in Hong Kong can not provide them with a happy retirement life as they do not understand about the benefits of Mandatory Provident Fund ( MPF ) scheme and hence do not care about it .|||21~22~Nn~respondents

Too much of the nation 's budget is spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for country 's development .|||28~28~ArtOrDet~the

It can also be argued that there is a greater need to spend on infrastructure development as it is an important area for a country development .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , if government spending on the aged does not limit but increases due to aging population issue , the budget on infrastructure development will be lesser and this may affect the country 's economic development negatively .|||17~18~Nn~issues

The government came up with The Maintenance of Parents Act in the 1996 and has been studying to best use this legal pressure to ensure that the children will take care of their parents as filial obligations would reduce the reliance of the elderly on the government , therefore , the government 's budget on the elderly need not be as huge .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~	20~21~ArtOrDet~	26~27~ArtOrDet~

The modern parents prefer to have fewer children compared to the past generation .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~
In a nutshell , it may be said without fear of contradiction that the current policies have helped to ease the aging process to a large extend .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~any
At present , the median age is 36.7 ( Singapore Statistics , 2008 , Key Annual Indicators , ¶ 2 ) and it is estimated that if current demographic trends persist , the median age will rise to 41 years by 2030 , lagging behind only by Japan .|||30~31~Vt~persisted
( Wijaya , 2009 , ¶ 3 ) The rapid growth in ageing population brings in controversial issues , one of which is related to the allocation of expenditure for the aged .|||15~16~Prep~about
( Wijaya , 2009 , ¶ 10 ) Although it is one of the lowest expenditure in comparison to other countries , the fast-ageing population makes it difficult for Singapore government not to increase public spending on the aged and allocate more on other areas instead , such as the Research & Development industry .|||29~29~ArtOrDet~the
The three main problems associated with the fast-ageing population point out that public spending should not be limited and allocated to other areas .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~a
They are lower birth rate , rising healthcare development costs to meet growing ageing needs and the economic loss incurred from a neglected ageing society 's welfare system .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
With the implementation of the Maintenance of Parents Act in Singapore , it is arguable that the young generations are not only morally responsible , but also compelled to take care of their aged parents independently .|||29~30~Vform~taking
However , the low fertility rate in Singapore challenges this argument because the financial burden resulting from the provision of aged parents is currently increasing on the fewer offspring .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~
Moreover , the rising cost of living such as increasing healthcare costs add on further strains to the limited young generation 's income , which often led to many cases whereby the children are unable to fend for their parents and thus abandon them .|||13~14~Prep~	26~27~Vt~lead	33~34~Vt~being	42~43~Vt~abandoning
( Wijaya , 2009 , ¶ 7 ) Hence , this shows that even with current government assistance such as healthcare subsidies and tax reliefs , nevertheless , the low fertility rate in Singapore continues to urge the government to expand public spending on the aged in order to meet the needs of the ageing society .|||53~54~ArtOrDet~an
That being said , the majority perceive that current public spending amount on the development of healthcare facilities is sufficient to meet the ageing demands .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , hospitals are constantly facing the common problems of shortage of beds and long average waiting time ; the major factor of this problem is the geriatric patients .|||10~11~Nn~shortages
The geriatric patients are often the ones who occupy majority of the hospital bed space and they suffered from chronic illnesses that require regular follow-up consultations .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the	11~12~ArtOrDet~
A neglected ageing welfare system causes social instability to the country , for instance , the citizens would feel cash-strapped with the rising healthcare costs and there would be myriad cases reporting about elderly poverty or abandoned elderly .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
All in all , it has become a fact that Singapore is currently facing a fast- ageing population and clearly shows that many problems will arise should public spending on the aged be limited , such as increasing financial burden on the fewer offspring , insufficient funds for rising healthcare development costs and losing of Singapore 's economic competiveness .|||43~44~Nn~offsprings
The four tiger economics in East Asia ; Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan , and South Korea have taken the approach to being a 'light welfare state ' , in which they had achieved high standard of living without burdening the state with heavy social expenditures ( Midgley , 1986 ) .|||33~34~Vt~have
In contrast , the western welfare states that fund heavily on social expenditure have hindered the functioning of private market .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
With no limits set on the expenditure of welfare for the aged , a country with an aging society will face enormous financial burdens with regards to the funding of public pension system , expensive healthcare system and long-term dependency expenditures .|||30~30~ArtOrDet~the
It is estimated that if the deficit budget continues , Hong Kong 's $ 369 billion fiscal reserves would be wiped out by 2008-2009 ( South China Morning Post , February 23 , 2002 ) .|||8~9~Vt~continued

In addition , there are the public and private sector mix of welfare programs and organization .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	15~16~Nn~organizations
Family support and close kinship , which exists strongly in Asian society , has also helped in decreasing state 's welfare dependency .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~an	18~18~ArtOrDet~the

However , some may argue that the elderly may not be fit enough to work and as there are doubts by employers if older workforce can achieve similar level of efficiency that are expected from younger workers , therefore this makes it more difficult for elderly to look for a job .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the	27~27~ArtOrDet~a	35~35~ArtOrDet~the	45~45~ArtOrDet~the

However , better healthcare and protection from government result in rising age expectancy , which is a double-edged sword because on one hand , people live longer as shown in report ( Friedland and Summer , 2005 , Fig 1-2 ) and on the other hand , the proportion of aging population increases if the younger generation are not reproducing enough , and this is exactly the trend today in developed nations .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	30~30~ArtOrDet~the
In the fast-paced society nowadays , there are several factors , such as high living cost and late marriage , discouraging people from reproducing " If fertility rates do not rise again , the problem will worsen as the median age in many first-world countries will reach 51 by 2050 , " as claimed by Peterson .|||15~16~Nn~costs	18~19~Nn~marriages

True as it seems , the question posed here is how the government should allocate its resources to cope with this problem .|||11~14~ArtOrDet~should the government

The aging processes in Singapore with the ensuing serious impact have drawn our attention .|||9~10~Nn~impacts ,
Aging process requires special attention because due to the low birth rate , Singapore has became an aging country with a large fraction of its population being aged .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The aging
The governments are currently carrying out research and implementing policies to help to ease the aging process for both the elderly and country .|||1~3~Vt~government is	22~22~ArtOrDet~the

Researches on healthcare and infrastructure had been constantly improving to ease the aging process .|||0~1~Nn~Research	5~6~Vt~has

As saying said prevention is better than cure , thus the government sector such as the health promotion board and the Singapore eye care centre had constantly organizing campaign to draw the awareness of the elderly regarding the serious consequence associate with the illnesses .|||25~26~Vt~is	28~29~Nn~campaigns	39~40~Nn~consequences	40~41~Vt~associated
This is because for those elderly who are illiterate and living alone may not know that there are such campaigns going on as they are unable to read campaign publish on the newspaper neither do they understand the advertisement that is telecasted over the television as they are mostly in English or Chinese .|||28~29~Nn~campaigns	29~30~Vt~published	37~38~ArtOrDet~

Policies complement the researches .|||3~4~Nn~research
Given the high cost of living in Singapore , the government had provided benefits for the elderly by granting subsidizes on healthcare .|||11~12~Vt~has
This policy works well because the aged would have their saving use for daily expenses such as food and necessity .|||11~12~Vform~used
Apart from subsidy , the government had reorganizes the healthcare system to cater to the need of the elderly .|||2~3~Nn~subsidies	6~8~Vt~have reorganized	15~16~Nn~needs
For example , the government had taken a step-down approach by including more community hospital and nursing home in the health care sector that are more affordable than staying in the hospital .|||5~6~Vt~have	14~18~Nn~hospitals and nursing homes
This policy is workable as elderly can recuperate better in the community hospital as they do not have to worry much about the medical fees .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	10~11~ArtOrDet~a
Also , the community hospital provides convenience as it is near the neighborhood thus enable them to get medical aid soon after they fell sick and it help to assure their children that there 's someone to attend to their sick parents when they are at work .|||2~5~Nn~community hospitals	14~15~Vt~enabling	23~24~Vt~fall
With this , even there is subsidy ; the elderly will still not be able to afford medical expenses .|||5~7~Nn~are subsidies
The next policy that is suggested is to give rebate to those who purchase a house that is close to their parents .|||9~10~Nn~rebates
This is likely to encourage the children to visit their parent often thus giving them a sense of warmth and security in return .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	10~11~Nn~parents
Some children will only make use of the reason to get as much subsidy as possible and they might not visit their parent even though they are living very near .|||22~23~Nn~parents
Therefore , although all these approaches provided limited ways in easing the aging process it is still a feasible and practical approach with the current research and policies implemented which had worked fairly well .|||6~6~Vt~have only	9~10~Prep~of
Only a small group of the aging population faces the limitations and the government can also come out with other policies to solve the problems so that the approach implemented can workable without any flaws and limitation .|||36~37~Nn~limitations
Besides relying on the government , Singaporeans must also pay attention to aging issue and help to play a part to reduce elderly dependence on the government .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the	20~22~Vform~in reducing
For instance , they can help to take care of their aged parent , be a volunteer to contribute to society that is gradually aging and works with the government .|||12~13~Nn~parents	20~20~ArtOrDet~a
They must put themselves in the elderly 's shoe and realize that one day they will also be aged and they will also need the support of their children and others .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	8~9~Nn~shoes
In Singapore , the increasing life expectancy with the high-quality healthcare and the declining fertility rates are the causes of graying population .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	8~9~ArtOrDet~	12~13~ArtOrDet~	20~20~ArtOrDet~the
Besides slow economic growth , the result of an ageing population is the rising pension and healthcare costs , which forces major increase in public spending in Singapore .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~one	8~9~ArtOrDet~the	21~21~ArtOrDet~a
This is because over the years Singaporeans are encouraged and educated to be financially independent , self-reliant and plan for their old-age so as not to be overly dependent on the government .|||7~8~Vt~have been
For instance , Singapore established its social security through the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) since 1955 , which is a mandatory savings programme that fund pensions and healthcare for each citizen ( Burton , 2007 ) .|||31~33~Nn~citizens
One example would be the passing of Maintenance of Parents Act that allow parents to sue their children for financial support ( Wijaya , 2009 ) .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
In other words , public spending on the aged can be limited so that the government can pour in more state 's fund into other areas of the country 's development such as education , research and development ( R&D ) , urban development and upgrading of public housing and transport .|||46~47~Prep~
As a result , these ongoing efforts to invest and develop the nation benefits the future generations of all ages .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
Firstly , despite the fact that CPF is a flexible scheme to enforce savings for individuals , it has shows signs of weakness and was seen as insufficient to last for one 's retirement years ( Tsao , 2008 ) .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the	19~20~Vt~shown	24~27~Vt~has been seen as being
One of the fundamental reasons for the insufficient fund in one 's CPF is the population 's needs to finance their public housing especially with the government encouragement .|||6~9~Nn~insufficient funds
Furthermore , CPF does not protect certain segment of the population who were not able to work and save during their younger days .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	7~8~Nn~segments
For instance , the housewives were not able to contribute to their Medisave because they had to raise their family and choose not to work as a result .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	21~22~Vt~chose
These reasons continue to urge the government to expand the public spending on the aged so as to sustain the needs and livelihood of the aged within the population .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
In a survey , it was reported that 66.0 % of senior citizens aged 55 and above were provided with regular cash contribution from their children .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~a
Additionally , it has shown that the dependence on children to finance their healthcare expenditure increased with age and only 35.8 % of senior citizens aged 55 and above have a clean bill of health ( Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [ MCYS ] , 2005 ) .|||4~4~Vt~been	6~7~ArtOrDet~
In other words , most elderly are rather dependent on their children to support them particularly those who suffered from chronic illnesses .|||6~6~Nn~people	18~19~Vt~suffer
This dependence is coupled with the rising healthcare cost that is taking a toll on their children 's finances .|||5~9~Nn~rising health care costs
Therefore , government ought to increase its public spending to assist and ease the strain of the children to support their aged parents .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	16~17~ArtOrDet~	18~20~Vform~supporting
On the whole , as Singapore population ages rapidly , it accentuates the need to increase the public spending on the aged in order to meet greater healthcare demands and rising cost of living .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~	30~30~ArtOrDet~the
As discussed earlier on , the rising healthcare costs coupled with longer living parents put pressure on their cash-strapped children to provide for their elderly parents .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
Apart from that , the aged is also burdened by the inadequate funds in their CPF accounts with several reasons for the inadequacy .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
Nowadays , aging population is increasing and the problem is to be more serious .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the

From other perspective , an increase in the aging population will lead to an increase in the government spending on the elderly .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
According to the statistic , the elderly dependency ratio in Singapore is 11.9 per 100 in 2008 .|||2~4~Nn~statistics
However , public spending on the senior citizens should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of country 's development such as taking care of the needy , the unfortunate , the young and infrastructure .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	21~21~ArtOrDet~the
Public money that is saved can be diverted to build infrastructure because it benefits all social classes such as the elderly , the needy , the unfortunate and the young by increasing their social welfare .|||9~10~Vform~building
In addition , an increase of infrastructure can attract investment from abroad because the facilities are fully equipped .|||5~6~Prep~in	13~14~ArtOrDet~

If other prior areas of the country 's development such as education , economy are not be invested adequately , future generation of older people are likely to be even worse .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the	21~22~Nn~generations
The first reason is that if people are not be educated well in their young days , their lives in the old age will be very vulnerable as people with more education tend to have higher incomes and better health .|||20~21~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , concentrating on prior areas of the country 's development instead of investing significant amount of money in the aged is likely to ensure better lives for future groups of older people .|||15~16~Nn~amounts	18~19~Prep~on
Because little medical and welfare programs are launched when decrease government expenditure on the aging population , many people may have not enough money to send their old parents to rest home .|||1~2~Nn~few	31~32~Nn~homes

Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer ( 2005 ) mentioned that with economic growth , there will be a lower demand for government 's handouts and there will be more funds made available for elderly welfare programmes .|||23~24~Nn~
Thus education , which helps to sustain future economic growth , is an aspect where the spending on the aged must be carefully limited in order to prevent any compromise .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~

While liberals view social welfare as a legitimate function of government and provision of welfare as citizens ' rights , I would beg to differ as a welfare state may end up heading towards a 'bottomless pit'- one which requires relentless public spending , in this case , on the aged and is indifferent to the person 's capability in attaining self-sufficiency .|||55~56~ArtOrDet~a
As such should we spend more or even lavishly on building eldercare support , we could be significantly depriving other areas for progress : economic sector due to the shortage of funds for investments , and social environment due to the limited resources for enhancing quality of living , to name a few .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the	36~36~ArtOrDet~the	45~45~ArtOrDet~the

Such perspective , in my opinion , would instead create an impression that one can rely on the state at old-age , and result in the sapping of the incentives to work and save for retirement age .|||19~20~Prep~during	28~29~ArtOrDet~

This is certainly a very large demographic number for the governing states to deny support because public spending , on the aged , if limited , will incur more disadvantages than advantages , not only to the aged who will be directly affected , but also to the overall society as a whole due to the fact that the members in the society interact with one another .|||58~59~ArtOrDet~	61~62~ArtOrDet~

In such society accompanied by materialism and ageism , the needy aged will be pushed to their ends as many of them are vulnerable to be abandoned even by their children who might deny their responsibilities of supporting their aged and sick parents .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~a

However , they receive little salary , which can hardly cover the increasing cost of the medical bills .|||4~6~Nn~low salaries
Thus , the cost of medical purposes is considered as expensive by aged especially those who hold low-income jobs or living alone without the support of the family .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the

Although it is true that ageing population is less severe in developing countries at present , it may not stay true for the future .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
Majority of the people in these countries , live in villages .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The majority
Hence , in future , when migration issue becomes a global pandemic , public should give a helping hand to the aged since the children will no longer take care of his needs .|||7~8~Nn~issues	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
The financial burden and the discrimination faced at the workforce are among the problems that the aged is going through .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~
There should be a level of awareness to help this aged so that he will age with dignity and pride .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~the
This is because we as individuals , sooner or later will reach at the ageing stage and will want our needs are being taken care of well .|||12~13~Prep~
Decisions on the allocation of government funds can impact different aspects of the society differently .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
So how would spending money on the elderly affect the society ?|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
However , the community and not only the government can help the weak elderly in the society .|||15~18~ArtOrDet~society
Thus , we should use the money to handle more pressing issue such as the health of the general public in this period whereby there are outbreaks of a lot of diseases such as avian flu and swine flu , that took the lives of many .|||41~42~Vt~have taken
Since there are definitely other ways to cope with aging population , governments should allocate its funds to other areas that are more urgent .|||10~12~Nn~populations
Furthermore , Governments should focus on other areas such as education and economic growth as tackling such areas will solve the problem of aging population in the long run , killing two birds with one stone .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~an
Increase in economic growth will also lead to increase in employment .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~an
In this scheme , a portion of a person 's monthly salary will be deposited into the CPF account on a monthly basis and it can only be withdrawn at the age of 55 , thereby assuring financial independence of elderly .|||40~40~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , I feel that public funding should be limited as it may cause the elderly to be over reliant on it and the money should be used elsewhere in areas such as public health that is more pressing and on education and economic growth that will also help to solve aging population .|||52~52~ArtOrDet~the
By carefully allocating government funds , the society will benefit as a whole .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
There is a need to understand that the amount of reliance the aged have on the public is quite significant , also to take into account of the contributions the aged have made and as well as to recognize the more substantial advancement in other main areas of development over the aged .|||26~27~Prep~
Critics commented that other areas of the country 's development such as education need the money to substantiate the advancement of these particular developments so as to bring them to greater heights so limitations on public spending on the aged should be enforced .|||1~1~Vt~have
However , there is the recognition of the fact that the government in developed countries has already pumped in a huge amount of money to develop the main areas of development like education and national defence .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Nn~governments
In addition , aging population has not been an area of concern in the past and only recently the aged have formed a significant population in developed countries .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~an
Cynics mentioned that in developed countries , quite a number of the aged are still working and receiving wages so they will have the means to pay for their living expenses and healthcare costs .|||1~1~Vt~have
In addition , the aged are still quite vulnerable to diseases and are weak , thus public spending on the aged should not be limited so as to assist them in their healthcare costs .|||30~31~Prep~with
Thus it is important to spend more now to ease the problems of aging population if not years later the problems of aging population might heap up .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~an
They are deemed useless and with low productivity and can not contribute significantly to the society .|||14~17~ArtOrDet~society
In time to come , the young can give back to the society unlike the aged .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~
Without their contributions , we may not be where and what we are now , thus it is the society 's responsibility to take care of them , regarding this as a repayment back to the aged .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
This might lead to foreign corporations being discouraged to invest in Singapore as Singapore might be perceived as not having an effective system Therefore it can be concluded that the aged should have a bigger portion of the pie that is the public spending while the other areas will still be having their share too to maintain their standards in developed countries .|||45~46~ArtOrDet~	50~52~Vt~have
This is due to developed countries having an aging population coupled with higher cost of living .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~a
Firstly , funds that are needed to support these welfare programs will come from the taxes on the working-age adult .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
The high cost of healthcare services results in high taxation on the citizens .|||11~14~ArtOrDet~citizens
With a lower GDP , the country generates lesser revenue to divert to other areas of a country 's development .|||8~9~Nn~less
However , public spending on the aged is only a short term solution to the problem of aging population .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~the
This short term solution poses as a burden to the economy without actually addressing the root of problem of aging population in the long run .|||5~6~Prep~	19~19~ArtOrDet~the
Public spending will only continue to spiral upwards if government is committed to healthcare spending on the aged .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
The government should look at this problem in an economic perspective in the long run .|||7~8~Prep~from

The issue on aging population has become an increasing important issue in our society today .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~an
The problems caused by aging population are increasing and it has placed great pressure on our society .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~an
Hence , the government is paying more attention to solve these problems caused by aging population through various means .|||9~10~Vform~solving
One of them is to increase the public spending on the aged .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
However , some may argue that by doing so it may limit the country 's development .|||6~7~Prep~
I feel that public spending on the aged should not be limited because the issue on aging population has become a major problem in the society .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~an
Other areas of the country 's development are equally important and hence government funds should also be directed to these areas such as education and healthcare sectors instead of just focusing on the aged .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~
Education is equally important because the young will determine the country 's development in the future since they would be the ones who will lead the country .|||18~20~Vt~are
In addition , the healthcare sector is also very important as it can help increase the standard of living of the people .|||20~21~ArtOrDet~
Some may point out that there are increasingly more people attaining higher level of education hence they are able to afford the increasingly expensive healthcare services .|||12~13~Nn~levels
Therefore , the public spending on the aged should not be limited .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
In addition , public spending on the aged should not be limited as people are having longer life expectancy as compared to the past and they will face larger financial risks of health .|||14~16~Vt~have
In Singapore , the government has come up with policies such as Medisave and Medishield to prepare the people by saving a portion of their salary in these accounts .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
In conclusion , even though the issue of aging population is important , we can not neglect the other areas that are essential to a country 's development .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~an
In recent years , many countries are beginning to face the sticking issue of ageing demographic and undeniably , Singapore is one of the fastest ageing populations in Asia .|||6~8~Vt~have begun	15~16~Nn~demographics
Indeed , money has to be spent to curb ageing problems but it is the society 's responsibility to ensure a desirable standard of living for the elderly , and to constantly fulfill the varying needs of this group of senior citizens .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
Moreover , part of the public fund should also be spend on re-training schemes for working adults so as to improve their work quality and efficiency , as well as to keep them skilled and valuable for the industry .|||10~11~Vt~spent	37~38~ArtOrDet~
For example , Research and Development in pharmaceutical is particularly important as the creation of new drugs will help in the advancement of medical and clinical studies .|||7~8~Nn~pharmaceuticals
With more sophisticated health care system , it will in turn helps to reduce medical spending on the age and might even help elderly to sustain good health .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
Many considerations have to be made when it comes to the topic of dividing the public funding .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
No doubt that it is essential to take care of the elderly who have contributed much to the society during their younger days , but the government must still ensure that there is enough funding on other areas of the country 's development .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~

For example , in United States it is governed by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , in Singapore by the Info-Communications Development Authorities of Singapore and in Malaysia by the Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
For example , in 1985 [ 2 ] , a decision by the FCC of United States to open several bands of wireless spectrum , so-called " garbage bands " ( 900 - 928 MHz , 2400 - 2483.5 MHz , 5725 - 5850 MHz bands ) without the need for government license has spawned growth in R&D in that area .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the
Due to this decision many " unlicensed " wireless technology products for communication purposes were developed , such as the Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , Wi-Max applications which operated using the spectrum of the garbage band .|||28~29~Vform~use

The birth of the battery can be back to several hundreds years ago , but it failed to dominate the energy carrier market since its two obvious weakness , which can not be improved easily .|||27~28~Nn~weaknesses
It can only be used in some trivial electric devices such as mp3 player .|||13~14~Nn~players
The second weakness of battery is its charge time : comparing to the refueling of the fossil fuel , the battery charge takes too much time .|||10~11~Vform~compared
These two elements together impede battery to be an instant energy carrier , and finally lead to today 's situation of energy carrier market .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
To enhance the capacity of the battery , keep trying new materials is important .|||8~9~Vform~keeping
Since the new battery is designed to use in the big machines to replace engines , the capacity will have the priority .|||7~8~Vform~be used
The popularization of battery is not isolated ; as an energy carrier , it should be together with the innovation of the electrical cars and other engineering products to form an industry chain .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
The chain will also include the battery charge station , which will replace the refueling station as the popularization of battery .|||16~17~Prep~with
To sum up , the engineering design process can be a good way to innovate new generation of battery .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~a

Right from education every other field in India is flooded with corrupt officials who primarily work with a self centered mindset to misappropriate and amass huge amount of money .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~a
These individuals are indifferent to the fact that majority of India 's population is below the poverty line .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
The problems that contribute to it is that there are not many quality engineers left in Malaysia and the local society 's mindset .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~this

In order to resolve these problems , a new generation of nuclear energy system which is called the Fourth Generation reactors is under test .|||22~23~Vform~undergoing	23~24~Nn~tests
One of the six approaches that named as supercritical-water-cooled reactor can give us a way for our future energy with further researches .|||7~8~Prep~
Supercritical-water-cooled reactors share the benefits of Generation IV and some further benefits compared with other kinds of reactors , SCWR may also resolve some concerns about safety and cost with some further development .|||19~20~Nn~SCWRs
SCWR as one of the six reactor concepts for Generation IV nuclear fuel , share the same advantage with all other reactors and some further predominance compared with other reactors .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The
Sustainable means that the system should generate power by some natural fuel , at the same time , minimize the environmental impact .|||18~19~Vform~minimizing
The focus is to decrease the emission of radiation and insure the safety of civilians once accident happen .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~an
Compared with other reactors , SCWR is advanced as its higher thermal efficiency ( about 45 % versus 33 % for LWR ) and simple plant .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	21~21~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , the SCWR does not require steam separator plates , heat exchangers nor turbines compared with BWR .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~the
( Tilkki V. Supercritical Water Reactors : A Survey on International State of Research in 2006 , 2006 ) All the simple design reduced the construction cost of nuclear electrical station .|||23~24~Vt~reduces	28~28~ArtOrDet~the
Also the coolant of SCWR is water which is cheaper compared with other kinds of reactors .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
Although SCWR owns lots of benefits , two main concerns about the cost and safety limited the population of this reactor .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	15~16~Vt~limit
Opponents way argue that the cost of nuclear energy is not equivalent to what we have paid .|||15~17~Vt~pay
For the operating cost , the cost of producing electricity has decreased from 3.63 cents per KWHr to 1.68 cent since 1987 .|||19~20~Nn~cents
In fact , these costs are all affordable compared with other kinds of method .|||13~14~Nn~methods
( Everything you want to know about Nuclear Power , n.d. ) Thus , in the future , the nuclear electricity can share the same price with other fossil resource electricity .|||26~27~Prep~as
On the other hand , some one doubt about the safety of the SCWR .|||8~9~Prep~
Some processes for SCWR can not be achieved safely by present technology , but the scientists are really working hard on them and some breakthrough had been made .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~Prep~with	14~15~ArtOrDet~	24~25~Nn~breakthroughs	25~26~Vt~have

Not only does design entail magnificent facade or a weird opinion of a maverick , but it also involves pragmatism , cost and efficiency .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~a	8~9~ArtOrDet~the
Quite the opposite , while there is a highly increasing demand in engineers with acuity of design , even in the education system of my own country , there are two major setbacks for engineering students getting adequate design skills : the lack of practice in school and the insufficiency of co-curricular activities .|||11~12~Prep~for
Although the curriculum has recently been continually improved to gradually reduce the conventional teaching method , the reality is still a void in students ' lab skills .|||14~15~Nn~methods
Only in the urban areas can students have opportunities to get access to the required equipments .|||15~16~Nn~equipment
Regarding students in other places , they can merely see the teacher do a sample experiment in the lecture but can not try by themselves .|||23~24~Prep~
According the Labor Newspaper , Hung Yen , a south province of Viet Nam , there are thousands of students are studying without sufficient lab equipments due to the delay in project of purchasing new equipments and corruption .|||1~1~Prep~to	5~5~Prep~in	25~26~Nn~equipment	35~36~Nn~equipment
The residue of this migration is an old generation teachers who do not much familiar with modern device in labs .|||17~18~Nn~devices
Consequently , students do not have chance to learn the priceless pragmatic experience of how to design in work .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
This can be accounted for the fact there are few organizations in almost all schools .|||5~5~Prep~by
Though activities held by the above organizations ranged from learning history , stance to acquiring leadership , not many students were benefited from them .|||20~21~Vform~
Moreover , since co-curricular is not compulsory in our country , and the studying in other learning centers takes up almost all time of students , they tends to drop co-curricular activities in school .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~the
The Youth Newspaper recorded a New Zealand professor that Vietnamese students spent so much time to study academic knowledge that co-curricular activities became something " luxurious " .|||11~12~Vt~spend	22~23~Vt~have become	23~27~Vt~a luxury
For them , the first step of design process seems to be far away as they can not define the problems completely since " people have a natural tendency to attack the current solution to a problem rather than the problem itself " ( Khandani , S. , Engineering design process , page 8 ) .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
As a result , all the rest of process can be ruined because of the first steps , for example , if the problem statement is not broad enough , the statement will preclude the new thoughts on the issue .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	34~35~ArtOrDet~
This is because they will lack of confident in communication with other colleagues to gather information as well as learning experience , so they hardly can find out the most effective information , let alone their inaptitude in information-searching method .|||4~5~Vt~	6~7~Prep~
Co-curricular activities also give engineering students necessary creativity and imagination to come up with many answers for a single question .|||16~17~Prep~to
However , with efforts to reform education , I optimistically believe that we can overcome these obstacles to be competitive engineers in global market .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the	22~22~ArtOrDet~the
In Singapore , there are problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovations .|||12~13~Nn~innovation
These problems may cause impacts to the market ; like unavailability of new products , poor design outcome and changing mindsets of potential designers .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
First , it is the lack of creativity .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~a
In Singapore , a number of us are the lazy type , which means we are lazy to design .|||8~8~Prep~of
For example , from Marcelo Ang 's ( 2009 ) talk , he mentioned that it is always the mental block of an individual that makes everyone thought of not to go for designing .|||3~4~Prep~in	27~28~Vt~think	30~32~Vform~going
Hence the need to remove that mental block , so that the individuals will have the opportunity to design and invent what they desire for .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~	24~25~Prep~
This in turn will cause the market to suffer , in the article Designing engineers to change the world , Chan ( 2009 ) mentioned that market users always demand for new products , which they are fascinated with .|||30~31~Prep~

This will result to poor designs produced in the market .|||1~3~Vt~results	3~4~Prep~in	6~6~Vform~being
Hence market users will not be tempted to buy the product , which would cause the sales and market to be low .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~	18~18~ArtOrDet~the
Additionally , this will also lead to loss income to the designer as they might not earn their production cost back .|||3~6~Vt~also leads	9~10~Prep~for
In conclusion , the lack of creativity and the time to create a design could cause impacts to the market in Singapore .|||17~18~Prep~on
These problems that may hamper the engineering design would impact the market causing the unavailability of new products , designers taking shortcuts in design and changing mindsets about design .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
In addition , this would lead to market downturn .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a
I believe that if an individual takes up the courage to change , and design a proper design , it would resolve the problems that are hampering the design process for innovations .|||31~32~Nn~innovation
However the standard of research and innovations being administered in every country varies to a great deal .|||6~7~Nn~innovation
Therefore the amount of money the government can afford to spend on the research projects is quite less comparatively .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~

Innovation engineering has been a commonly recurrent phrase among the industries in the recent years .|||8~9~Prep~in
In the Singapore society where it is relatively result orientated , people tend to be afraid to try out new ideas as they are afraid they will lose out to the intense competition they face from the others .|||36~37~ArtOrDet~
Hence , engineers will rather stick to tried and proven methods that are seen to be effective , instead of explore for more alternative methods .|||20~21~Vform~exploring
This gradually develops into an inflexible culture , whereby our workers choose to stick to current beliefs rather than try out new ideas .|||1~3~Vt~has gradually developed
Generating new concepts do not just require a single day of effort , as what people believe , but instead require a longer thought process which may take days or even months .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~does
Innovative engineering requires the engineer to venture into areas which have yet to be explored , which makes the experience even more vital , as it would allow problems to be identified even before they occur .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~

People do not know how to make use of the new technologies and new products so that it is easy to imagine the situation where engineering design processes for innovations receive not much or little support from the public in China and people .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~

It does not just waste a lot of time for an innovation project , but also passes away the mood of inspiration for innovation .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~This

After the accident , people tried to figure out what are the reasons that caused the malfunction of the power plant .|||10~11~Vt~were
Several theories had been provided , but mostly concentrated on two issues : the mistakes of the reactor crew and the deficiency in the design of the RBMK ) reactor ( high-power channel reactor - reactor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny ) ( World Nuclear Association,2007 ) .|||2~4~Vt~were	31~31~ArtOrDet~a

Since a nuclear reactor is described as a " complex high hazard systems " ( Wilpert,2007 ) , the adequate and clear cognition are very important not only for the individuals but also for the whole workers in the manufacture , where the collaboration between them plays the key role in the work of the plant .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
If the Chernobyl reactor crew had had enough information about the dangerous caused by the reactor when working in low power settings , they would have never performed the test to determine how long turbines would spin and supply power following a loss of main electrical power supply .|||34~34~ArtOrDet~the

An absolute evident that proves the necessary of psychological design is the similar accident with the Three Miles Island nuclear reactor in the US .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~a
These examples show that even the machine errors can be eliminated by carefully design and applying psychology in the design process to predict all the cases that may happen in the future .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
Since the horrible accident of Chernobyl , such old technologies used to build the Chernobyl reactor have never been used again .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~the

With the more and more collaboration between psychology and design , the engineers have been using their results for the design process to make more reliable and stable products .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~

According to the news report by Rita Zahara ( 2005 ) , " Singapore is only rank 15 in the world for its innovative capabilities .|||16~17~Vform~ranked

Secondly , Singaporeans ' refusal to take risk and their contentment with their current lifestyles are also causes for the hampering of engineering design processes for innovation in Singapore .|||7~8~Nn~risks
The mindset of resistances to change in Singaporeans greatly prevents good innovative ideas and the acceptance of such ideas .|||3~4~Nn~resistance
They do not want any changes to what they already had .|||10~11~Vt~have

Most Singaporeans do not dare to try new ideas as they fear of failing , in which most probably results in time and money loss .|||12~13~Prep~
Singapore 's small economic market and its population holding a resistance to change attitude will have some bearing on the engineering design processes for innovation .|||14~15~Vt~

The " natural " factor that caused a spike in the number of gasoline-powered vehicles was the declining cost of oil at that point of time which made gasoline-powered vehicles a stronger competitor to the electric-powered vehicles , which were the more commonly- used vehicle .|||24~25~Prep~in	33~34~Prep~over
One of the key economical factor that Henry Ford induced was that he collaborated with banks and introduced car insurances and loans ( only if people purchased Ford 's vehicles ) , which actually amplified the effects of the declining cost of oil .|||5~6~Nn~factors
Furthermore , it also became more affordable in a sense that the insurances covered certain repair costs incurred by mishaps ; and loans allowed people to pay up slowly because there was no " pay by instalments " scheme back then .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~the
This convenience was the fact that gasoline was portable and could be brought around on vehicles which allowed vehicles to be re- fueled at any time and place and that it could be done very quickly .|||30~31~ArtOrDet~this
Apart from the influence by the military , the government had a part to play as well , because the government implemented biased policies that involved building more gas stations and roads to cater to the gasoline-powered vehicles .|||4~5~Prep~of

This means , engineers need creativity to make new beneficial things , and this is exactly what engineers in Indonesia lack , along with sense of innovation .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~a
On top of that , the questions given in school are usually too straight forward as the questions themselves do not test the deeper understanding of the concepts by the students .|||28~29~Prep~of
This kind of rote learning makes defining problems , which is the very first step of engineering design process , hard for Indonesian students .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , this forms a habit among the students that they also apply in real life which makes them ignorant on how things work and concern only about how to use those things .|||20~21~Prep~about
To make matter worse , even when someone survived that kind of education and has bright ideas , the government will not give them the opportunities to innovate , such as providing enough budgets for Research and Development ( R&D ) in Science and Technology , or easiness of taking loans for new businesses in these areas .|||2~3~Nn~matters	8~9~Vt~survives
This is because most developing countries ' governments , like Indonesia 's , still do not yet realize that a good innovative culture in the country can actually solve other problems like poverty and basic education opportunity .|||36~37~Nn~opportunities
Therefore as they do not have structured programmes regarding research and technology , there are only few job opportunities in this science and technology sector , further discouraging engineers to innovate .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~a	20~21~ArtOrDet~the

Newater represents the technology that purifies the used water to make it clean and drinkable again ( The Write Staff ) .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
During the last decade , the number of Newater plants increases to four .|||10~11~Vt~has increased
During Newater 's history , government , resources and the development of other technology show a significant influence on the development of Newater .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	13~14~Nn~technologies
First of all , government plays a determining effect on the development of Newater .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	5~6~Vt~has played
Concerning about the situation of water supply in Singapore , the government officials decide to focus on the Newater technology to meet the water demand in Singapore especially for the industry and commercial use ( The Write staff ) .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	13~14~Vt~decided
The successful development of Newater is due to enough funds that government has invested .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
With the support of Singapore government , the technology of Newater has blossomed and the fifth Newater plant has been successfully set up in the Chanqi area this year .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	18~20~Vt~was
Besides the support of Singapore government , a lack of water supply pushes the development of Newater .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	12~13~Vt~pushed
These reasons contribute to the development of Newater .|||2~3~Vt~contributed
With the pressure of water shortage , having its own water supply system becomes more and more necessary .|||13~14~Vt~became
That is how the resource shortage leads to the development of Newater .|||6~7~Vt~led

All of these factors have a positive effect on development of Newater and make it succeed .|||5~5~Vt~had	9~9~ArtOrDet~the	13~14~Vt~made
With time passing by , more and more new technology have been discovered or created , these technologies can be classified in two main patterns , one is the technologies which are developed by research , another type is the technologies which are resulted from serendipitous discoveries .|||0~1~Prep~As	2~3~Vt~passes	3~4~Prep~	10~12~Vt~are being	42~44~Vform~result

After the problem has been defined , which is the first step of engineering design ; engineers need to gather pertinent information about the problem .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~a
For example , engineering who focusing on design environmental friendly transportation tools , must have the basic knowledge about the products of different types of fuel combustion and how they affect the environment .|||5~6~Vform~focus	7~8~Vform~designing
They should also be updated about any latest methods to generate energy in environmental friendly ways , such as solar energy , tidal energy or wind energy , and their respective advantages and drawbacks .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~the

The second step of the design process is generating different solutions to the problems .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
First way is changing the way energy is generated , such as changing petrol engines which produce carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons to fuel cell which only produce water and oxygen .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The first	23~24~Nn~cells
This solution can be further divided by considering different types of method to generate energy in less polluting ways .|||11~12~Nn~methods
The other solution is dealing with the polluting products generated along the way .|||4~5~Vform~to deal

It is because changing the ways generating energy is very costly and the safety is unpredictable .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~This	6~7~Vform~to generate

Transportation which is cheap and safe , environmentally friendly and uses alternative source of energy has the utmost importance in the need of transportation .|||15~16~Vform~is
One of the imminent problems faced by the modern transportation is to depend less on fossil fuels .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~

Thus , the innovations of engineering processes are more and more important .|||4~5~Prep~in
And the two of most significantly are the state of information communication not smooth and the corruption .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~The	3~4~Prep~	15~16~ArtOrDet~

In this era of globalization , engineering design has been emphasized by the governments of the countries all over the world , such as United State , Russia and France .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
This is because the development of engineering design could bring many advantages to country 's economy and also in social aspect .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~a
Actually , the scientists may perceive a future problem and launch some researches to overcome it .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	4~5~Vform~	12~13~Nn~research

Nevertheless , there are some problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes for innovations in my home country , Malaysia and cause the impacts on certain stages of the process of engineering design .|||24~25~Prep~
As we all know , if we want to improve our engineering design , we need to launch many researches .|||19~20~Nn~research
Subsequently , a lump sum of money need to be used to launch all these researches , but our government is not able to invest so much money on all these researches .|||15~16~Nn~research
So , the financial problem arises and constrains the engineering design processes for innovations .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
Hence , we lack of money to improve our facilities of research such as well-equipped laboratories and other highly technological instruments .|||4~5~Prep~	10~11~Prep~for
In fact , this will causes the engineering design process to pause in the half way because of the lack of the highly technological instruments .|||5~6~Vform~cause	6~7~ArtOrDet~	9~10~Nn~processes	18~19~ArtOrDet~	21~22~ArtOrDet~

For instance , some of the automobile researches have been failed due to the lack of the professionals .|||7~8~Nn~research	9~11~Vt~	16~17~ArtOrDet~
The stage of analysis of design solution has been constrained because of the limited knowledge and lack of professionals .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~

Firstly , Indonesia lacks culture of innovation .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
According to the statistics published by UNICEF in 2007 , only fifty percent of Indonesian citizens are urbanized , which means the other half live in rural areas with little exposure to modern world and technology .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	32~32~ArtOrDet~the
People living in traditional villages live very simple life .|||8~9~Nn~lives
Moreover , the farmers still rely on the government supplies and subsidies , which encounters a lot of logistics problems , instead of innovating their own way of solving problems .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	7~8~ArtOrDet~
As mentioned before , Indonesia hosts more than two hundred and thirty million citizens , and its unemployment rate is considered high at 9.1 % ( Reuters , 2008 ) .|||5~6~Vform~has
Another effect is demotivation of young engineers from designing new product , because the rewards the society gives them is not equal to their long time hardworking .|||10~11~Nn~products
To tackle them , Indonesian government has to work hard in developing innovative culture in the society , and decreasing the people 's dependability on the government .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	12~12~ArtOrDet~an
According to Khandani 's statement " What distinguishes engineers from painters , poets , or sculptors is that engineers apply their creative energies to producing products or systems that meet human needs " , all engineering designs aim to meet human demand to become successful products .|||41~42~Nn~demands
Now , when the society becomes widely and continuingly developed , people are looking for new designs to satisfy their comfortable lives .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
Those new designs may be the demands of entertainment , education or even something beyond our imagination .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	7~8~Prep~for
However , in my opinion , one of the main concerns in our society is finding a new energy supply to alter the old ones , which become exhausted due to the overexploitation of human .|||27~28~Vt~have been	31~32~ArtOrDet~
In order to solve this urgent demand , engineering plays an important role in finding the other alternatives such as nuclear energy , solar energy and geothermal energy .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
Evidently , energy becomes vital and indispensable in our life , relating to most of everything we are working .|||3~4~Vt~has become
Because of the influence of energy , the natural resources have invisibly caused wars and conflicts between many countries over years and years .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
The recent war between United States and Iraq in 2000 might be considered to be a typical example .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
Although U.S. has been saying that this war was for the anti-terrorism , or more importantly for keeping the peacefulness of the world , it is clear that one of the reasons why American troopers stay in Iraq is the benefits of petroleum .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	8~9~Vt~is	10~11~ArtOrDet~	18~19~ArtOrDet~	20~21~Prep~
Due to the non-renewability of the natural " fossil " resources , the more demands the society needs , the more exhausted they become .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
The nuclear power is extracted from the usable energy from heavy atomic nuclei ( for example Uranium 235 ) via chain of nuclear reactions .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	20~21~ArtOrDet~
The first nuclear plant was built in Russia in 1984 whose initial electricity production is about 5000KW .|||14~15~Vt~was
However , the design of nuclear reaction has to meet many rigorous requirements to avoid the nuclear releases as well as to isolate the radiation from the life .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~	23~24~ArtOrDet~	26~27~ArtOrDet~
This disastrous accident results from the weakness in design and up to now , the neighboring areas still suffer from the radiation .|||3~4~Vt~resulted	5~6~ArtOrDet~

Thus , many countries spend more money and time on developing new resources which can be used as a substitution to petroleum .|||19~20~Vform~substitute	20~21~Prep~for
This can be seen through the increasing in research and development of the solar cars or other products .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
The using of the solar energy related goods has been highly encouraged by the environmentalists .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	13~14~ArtOrDet~
So I would like to discuss about the reasons of innovation of these technology in the following factors , named economic factor , government factors and environmental factor .|||6~7~Prep~	9~10~Prep~for
First of all , as what I have mentioned before , the petrol price was fluctuating in recent years , this makes many factories start to worry about the cost and the profit they can earn .|||14~15~Vt~has been	31~32~ArtOrDet~
It is because of the cost of the batteries .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
Presently , there is limitation of the amount of energy the batteries can store as we can only " use solar cells to generate up to 240 watts of electrical power in full sunshine " ( wikepedia ) .|||5~6~Prep~on
As long as we can find a way to increase the amount of the energy the batteries can store , the cost will not be much a problem anymore .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
So I think , although they have to spend much more on researches now , they can definitely save more in the long run .|||12~13~Nn~research
In conclusion , I think we should decrease the using of petrol related product and slowly switch towards using the products which need new resources .|||9~10~Vform~use	13~14~Nn~products

Humans ' activities on Earth have always been depleting Earth 's valuable yet limited amount of natural resources and at the same time damaging Earth 's environment .|||6~9~Vform~depleted	24~24~ArtOrDet~the
This will cause Earth 's natural resources to be depleted and modifying Earth 's environment so much that it is no longer suitable for human life .|||1~3~Vt~causes
Firstly , engineering processes that are available now and are widely used can be abolished while new ones can be introduced to perform the function of its predecessor and at the same time fulfilling the need .|||24~25~Nn~functions

However , this method may not suitable for those developing and undeveloped countries because it costs a lot of money , and the technology required is also very high .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
Another limitation of this method is that it can only be applied in seaside countries , like Singapore , which means that it is not the first choice to many inland countries .|||28~29~Prep~of
Therefore , since the two methods mentioned above are both costly and difficult to apply , they can be restricted by the economic and market and thus , they may be not able to solve the shortage of water in a short period .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the

Engineering systems play important roles in all the fields ; for example entertainment , healthcare as well as education .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
Although it is essential for all the fields , engineering products and systems in healthcare and medical fields should be given the highest priority since health is the most important thing for all human beings .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
There are many healthcare products which are available in research organization but not widely available in current market .|||10~11~Nn~organizations	16~16~ArtOrDet~the

As mentioned in " Global action on aging " website that the number of senior citizens are rising and the action for this should be taken , it is obvious that increasing number of elder people and taking care of them has been necessary to be considered .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
It is also mentioned that since the number of elderly people increases , the burden of caring is also increasing for young people .|||11~12~Vt~is increasing
Hence , engineering should consider the situation of increasing number of elders and come out with the solution which can take care of situation in order to help elder people safe as well as make youth work without worry .|||16~18~Nn~solutions

By using the Engineering Design Process introduced by Seyyed Khandani , a professor at Diablo Valley College , we can reduce the famine .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
The World Food Program ( WFP ) has been providing food and aids to areas affected by famine since it established .|||12~13~Nn~aid

However , for Malawi , the WFP and the World Bank analyzed the solution and found out that it is better to donate cash to them ; as they did some researches and found out that the country has food resources , but the poor can not afford it .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~a	31~32~Nn~research
In 1990s , the WFP introduced the donation of cash and vouchers policies ; one of the pioneer countries that received this aids is Malawi .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
Thus , providing cash did not only help to solve the famine , it also improved the financial situation for the farmers .|||19~20~Prep~of
Furthermore , the WFP saved time and cost from the collection of food and delivering it to the affected areas .|||10~11~Vform~collecting	11~12~Prep~
In 1970s , the WFP has been providing food to India to temporarily solve the famine .|||5~8~Vt~provided	14~15~ArtOrDet~
During this period , they have been analyzing the situation to generate other solutions to permanently solve the famine .|||5~8~Vt~analyzed
The first off solution is to provide genetically modified seeds and fertilizers to the farmers , so that they will obtain higher yield .|||4~5~Vt~was	13~14~ArtOrDet~	19~20~Vt~would
Before this solution was implemented , they did a further study , and realized that the solution will not work ; as the farmers are using traditional farming methods which are not yield efficient .|||17~18~Vt~would	24~25~Vt~were
These aids have improved the famine situation as the famine dropped by about 20 % in a WFP 's 1990s report ; On the other hand , these solutions are not applicable to all the lands in India as various areas have different types of lands .|||2~3~Vt~	29~30~Vt~	34~35~ArtOrDet~

For an instance , the weapons and equipment used by the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF ) originated from countries like Germany and the United Kingdom .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
Funding and materials are crucial during an engineering design process as trials and equipment are require to gauge and judge the progress and the progress and outcome of a development .|||15~16~Vform~required
These rules and regulations are especially strict in Singapore , as a result engineering are often being restricted by these limitations which could hamper some bold yet useful innovation ideas .|||14~15~Vt~is
The lack of knowledge prevented engineers in Singapore to come out with brand new ideas for innovations .|||4~5~Vt~prevents	9~10~Vform~coming
As they are brought up in such an environment , they normally will develop a mindset that it will better to follow rules as it will be much more stable and fool-proof rather than trying to think out of the box and create or do something bold .|||18~19~Vt~is
In conclusion , these two main problems basically hamper the research and development area of engineering design process , Singapore engineers could only at the moment upgrade of modifies existing innovations .|||13~14~Nn~areas
A serendipity found is defined as accidently and unexpectedly discovering something fortunate .|||2~3~Vform~find
Unlike to a serendipity invention , a product or system that is created or developed , not coming from accidents , but through a series of engineering design processes is a research invention , and a technology developed via research is the mobile phone .|||1~2~Prep~
Firstly , compare the usages for both the sound-powered telephone and the mobile phone , they are similar in the way that both are used for communications .|||26~27~Nn~communication

During the brainstorming stage , engineers should have looked at the product in various angles ; the possibilities of doing harm to the environment while creating and testing the product , the ways to dispose off any toxic or radioactive wastes and the possibility of exploitation of product on immorality purposes .|||7~9~Vform~look	12~13~Prep~from
In conclusion , engineering design processes can meet the need of solving global warming by the improvement of catalytic converter and execution of cautious planning before any other procedures .|||19~20~Nn~converters
For example , for the lever type can opener is made of cast iron which makes it bulky for users who end up injuring themselves in an effort to use it .|||3~4~Prep~

As these companies manufacture products which are copied the basic design from others , the product design process is no longer for innovations .|||7~8~Vform~copy
There must be some reasons .|||4~5~Nn~reason
In recent years , lots of small companies appeared in southern China .|||8~8~Vform~have
In 2008 , the producing amount of this kind phones is more than 80 million in China .|||10~11~Vt~was
These phones have the exactly same appearance designs with big companies , even the first time you look at it , you can not identify which are produced by NOKIA and which are copied .|||8~9~Prep~as
As mentioned above , innovation design process will be hampered if companies copy ideas from others and reducing manufacturing cost .|||19~21~Nn~costs
This resulted in the low demand for locally designed products and often discourages engineers to continue in their innovations .|||1~1~Vform~has
Beside the lack of facilities , engineers are constrain by the strict regulatory imposed by the Governement .|||8~9~Vform~constrained
In conclusion , Engineering Process Design is a comprehensive guide for engineers who have no idea on how to go about designing a new product .|||16~17~Prep~about
However , in Singapore , engineers will find that they will meet into some problems that may hamper the design process .|||12~13~Prep~
Among those problems , the limitation of resources has raised a lot of concern from our society .|||14~15~Prep~for
Secondly , some of the technologies are still under testing .|||8~10~Vform~being tested
These two resources are restricted by the geographical position and climate .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
For instance , car is one of the most important transportations in the world ; however , new research has proved that the existing extra petroleum can only be used for another eighty to ninety years .|||20~21~Vt~proven
Natural resources around the world has been depleting at an alarming rate which has led to numerous debates and interventions by environmentalists , in a bid to reduce the amount of resources extracted and employed by mankind .|||5~8~Vform~are being depleted

Most of them will be varied along the process due to several factors and thus lead to different type of innovation .|||15~16~Vt~led	17~17~ArtOrDet~a
From my point of view , no matter on the sequence of innovation-development process , as long as there is a new invention , it is invented to benefit all the mankind .|||25~26~Vt~was	30~31~ArtOrDet~
Technology has improved so rapidly in the past century that men have threaded into outer space , harvest enormous amounts of energy from minute quantities of nuclear material , and yet there still exists the problem of food shortage .|||12~13~Vform~tread	17~18~Vform~harvested

Seyyed Khandani mentioned about a process called synthesis , which is to integrate ideas , equipment and processes to create new solutions ( 11 ) .|||3~4~Prep~
In spite of the increase of research and development in recent years , there is still a significant amount of discoveries and innovation are still been made by people outside of laboratories .|||25~26~Vform~being
However , we would define it more broadly to include all researches done without the aid of external aid .|||11~12~Nn~research
As mentioned by E.M. Rogers in his article The Birth of the Laptop Computer at Toshiba , Tetsuya Mizoguchi ,who came up with the idea of developing a mobile computer , had to went " underground " after his proposal was rejected by his superiors .|||33~34~Vform~go

Generally speaking , intended research to pursue development is similar with serendipitous discovery in terms of the aim and contribution to the human society .|||10~11~Prep~to	21~22~ArtOrDet~
First of all , the aim of technology which was developed with research is to explore some useful things and attempt to reach the unknown scientific area in order to solve the problems in real world .|||34~34~ArtOrDet~the

In this paper , I will discuss on two basic causes : education problem and economy problems , and explain the effects these two problems cause .|||7~8~Prep~
First , education is a big issue that government should improve to make citizens more talented and creative .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Government should advocate the education for all-round development to all the schools , and put more money into scientific development .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
Being country with a relatively small market dominated by large companies and a low spending consumer base , it is extremely difficult for new products to penetrate into the market and capture consumer attention without insufficient financing .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~a
However , there has been a lack of government support to such projects mainly due to defense expenses .|||10~11~Prep~for
The second reason that I feel makes it difficult for new engineering innovations to be successful is due to large number of professionally qualified Sri Lankans migrating to other countries .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
In addition , to lower their expenses they even temporary suspend all the research and develop process .|||10~11~Vt~suspended
Second problem that hampers engineering design in Malaysia is lack of technology systems .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The second

Disapproval of ideas due to fiscal reasons is one of the problems .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The disapproval
Firstly , the problem of the system of education is always existing as an obstacle for many aspects , especially in Engineering where creativity and innovation should be privileged , where the personal and original opinion should be highly respected , that is why we have to analyze to its core .|||9~11~Vt~has always been
" ( MYE forum , 08/06/2006 , para.1 ) .The quality of infra-structure and education serving tools are that low , same goes for the quality of teaching , but the main point here is the ones who have the right to change and improve that entire thing hardly taking a concern .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~The
From all the analyses above , we could see through the direct causes which influence the engineering design processes and innovations are the weakness in the administration of education system and governmental structure .|||7~8~Vt~can
Some people find it difficult to do so and interestingly enough , they even took courses to learn to be creative .|||14~15~Vt~take

These problems comprise of , insufficient funds , insufficient resources , design may not be aesthetically pleasing to be selected and copyright infringement .|||3~4~Prep~
Of these four identified problems , I would highlight two of them and the effects that they had on certain stages of the process .|||7~8~Vt~will
Lacking in funds can lead to the disruption of the progress of an engineering design process .|||1~2~Prep~of
The impacts that each problems had , can affect gravely on the progress of the engineering innovative design and they should be well- planned .|||1~2~Nn~impact
Among these problems , the two major problems are financial problem and technical problem .|||10~11~Nn~problems	13~14~Nn~problems
Moreover , it costs a lot to build modern working environment and high-tech facilities .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~a
Education system in Malaysia show too little concern for the engineering design academia .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The education
People lack of knowledge and information in engineering design , thus they are not able to deal with current and future practical problems .|||2~3~Prep~
On the other hand , Malaysia lack of skillful labor and this has resulted in an inefficient production of creative innovations .|||7~8~Prep~
Next step of defining the problem involves developing a problem statement which allows us to specifically address and successfully meet the need to have sufficient food .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The next
Well , technologies are there to supposedly improve our way of life .|||7~7~Vform~to
Smaller companies were unable to match these giants and thus remain stagnant .|||10~11~Vt~remained
With lack of advertising , their products were poorly accepted in the market .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
Besides companies being influenced by potential profitability and having gained access to better funding , social factors also played a part .|||2~3~Vt~are	18~19~Vt~play

In this new era of globalization , we must not deny the importance of implementation of design into engineering problem solving processes .|||17~18~Prep~in	18~18~ArtOrDet~the
These two are strongly related and without designing mind , engineers definitely could not solve a problem based on engineering knowledge .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a	12~13~Vt~can
Nowadays , people are having a misconception that design is just simply the planning that lays the physical shape and pattern of every object or system .|||3~5~Vt~have
For instance , in designing a car , internal combustion engine are specifically configured to work optimally and therefore the design of components such as cooling system and piston engine valves should be taken into consideration .|||10~11~Nn~engines
However , in our very own country , Malaysia , some problems have arisen in which significantly hamper the engineering design processes for innovation and these have resulted in severe impact on certain stages of the process .|||14~15~Prep~
The most common factor which contributes to the failing of the process is the insufficient fund provided to complete the whole process and by means , the process includes definition of problems , narrowing of research , finding of several alternative solutions , determination of the most possible solution and lastly the making of decision .|||29~29~ArtOrDet~the	54~54~ArtOrDet~the
If no fund is provided , such process could not be completed .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a	8~9~Vt~can
This could be explained because in order to determine the most possible solution in engineering design process , we have to conduct many experiments and these experiments require materials in which money must be injected into the project .|||1~2~Vt~can
This is simply due to the fact that it is not efficient and well designed enough to compete among all car retailers , which is the cruel truth that recognised by every Malaysians .|||32~33~Nn~Malaysian
With the money big corporation possesses , they are able to conduct Research and Development of their own product and at last launch out the product which is efficient and generates greater revenue compared to other smaller competitors .|||4~6~Nn~corporations possess
Another root problem that hampers engineering design process is the lack of education to engineers about engineering design knowledge during their tertiary education .|||13~14~Prep~for
Knowledge taught during lecture is not enough to develop student to think creatively and determine alternative solutions from problems arisen .|||9~10~Nn~students	19~20~Vt~arise
Furthermore there is none or simply only a few research laboratories are set up in campus to encourage undergraduates to determine problems generated themselves during experiment .|||14~15~Prep~on
In conclusion , engineering design process is important to meet complex challenges in the world such as global warming and all types of pollution .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
Fund must be injected to project in order to execute the process .|||5~6~Nn~projects
Lastly , education system must be reviewed in order to solve such challenges and bring us a new generation of engineers who are able to devise innovations guided by the perspectives of a true designer .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
On the other hand , they swicth their attention to production mode which involves much technological innovation .|||6~7~Vt~have switched
Regarding to the first problem , it is of high importance that we investigate the background of leaders in state-run entrepreneurs .|||1~2~Prep~
The leaders are directly appointed by central government .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
Thus , many importance positions in an entrepreneur belong to government officers , which as a result , makes the entrepreneur like government .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~the
In this way , they are not subject to fierce competition in a markect .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~the
The consequence is that a large number of the employees treats theirs jobs as " iron rice bowl " , which means a job is secure .|||22~23~ArtOrDet~the
In this way , the whole company corrupts and becomes obsolete .|||7~8~Vform~is corrupted
With regard to the next problem , the protection of law and the raise of public awareness must come into play .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
Moreover , the law enforcement is still weak and the punishment for violating the law is not severe enough .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
In addition , there are many cases about stealing of innovations or some famous brands .|||7~8~Prep~of
For example , even though the brand " Qsing Dao " beer was set up in China , it was an American businessman who first register the brand .|||25~26~Vt~registered

So when selection processing , the academic achievement of candidate is not the priority to be considered but their loyalty to the party .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore , in some institutes , the head tends to know nothing or have little knowledge upon the field which he is in charge of , which will certainly misguide the research directions and disturb the atmosphere of researching and studying .|||16~17~Prep~of

Because the heart pacemaker should be implanted into patient 's body before it can work well , it asks for higher safety requirement .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
The material used to make a pacemaker is silicon , titanium steel and special artificial plastic , both of them is quite friendly to patients ' internal environment and will not cause injury or other diseases to humans .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~the
An engineer should seriously consider that the pacemaker is used to save patient 's life , if it suddenly breaks down , the patient will face the risk of losing life .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the

After telephone was invented in the late 1800s , people were thinking about ways to improve such communication technology to extend the range of social network .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	16~17~ArtOrDet~the
The original idea of mobile phone came from combining telecommunication with radio technology which was considerably improved during the World War 2 period CITATION Spe90 \ l 2052 ( Special History Issue , 1990 ) .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
Until the 1980s , due to the cellular idea , the portability and the quality of communication of mobile phone were improved and mobile telephony started to play a part in mass market CITATION Tom07 \ l 2052 ( Farley , 2007 ) .|||31~31~ArtOrDet~the
This essay will examine three major factors in the development of mobile telecommunication in different stages .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
First of all , the post-war economic recovery demanded a better way of communication in order to expand the network of free trade between different countries .|||23~24~Prep~among
In the past , radio telephony was the only way to connect to telephone service when people were mobile .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Similarly , the development of necessary technologies such as semi-conductors , transistors and microelectronic chips also contributed to the development of mobile telecommunications .|||15~15~Vt~have
Therefore , progress in other fields can promote the innovations of mobile technology .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Unlike the business usage , private users demand a user-friendly environment to communicate with friends and family as well as some additional entertainment features .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
Besides , mobile phones became digitized at the beginning of this century , which brought a revolution of mobile telecommunication .|||15~15~Prep~on	17~18~Prep~in
Mobile phone today is no longer a phone that was mobile ; it can be a MP3 player , a game player and even a personal computer .|||9~10~Vt~is	15~16~ArtOrDet~an

However , still , there are many people who stood up to the difficulty and successfully completed the engineering design processes for innovations and I hope more people can learn from their experiences .|||13~14~Nn~difficulties
Since the 1970 's , communication technology has made great advances , offering capabilities that were unthinkable a decade earlier .|||15~16~Vt~are
This was the result of a better of a better understanding of people 's needs and what technology they really want to use .|||1~2~Vt~is
One such technology was the mobile phone .|||3~4~Vt~is
In the most unfortunate cases , the information would not even reach the desired destination .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~	6~7~ArtOrDet~
This all changed dramatically with the introduction of the telephone .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
The society wanted to be able to communicate anywhere and anytime and to anyone they wished .|||12~13~Prep~with
Having to do this would result a great benefit to an individual 's company and finally , it would have a positive impact on the economy .|||9~13~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , even the military benefited from this wireless telephony .|||5~5~Vt~has
Through the use of wireless communication , soldiers were able to communicate with each other swiftly and with 100 % accuracy when information was passed around .|||24~24~Vt~being
Due to the convenience of having a mobile phone , the number of mobile phone users increased drastically over the years .|||16~16~Vt~has
By 2002 , Japan had 55 million mobile phone users ( out of 122 million ) , China had over 200 million mobile phone users ( out of 1.3 billion ) and about 90 % of Finland 's population had a mobile phone according to BBC in 2003 .|||45~45~ArtOrDet~the
As a result , by 2003 , the mobile phone was presented more than just a tool for calling someone .|||12~12~Prep~as
It will also take on roles and an anchor point , a digital navigator and a lifestyle accessory that will help individuals control and enrich their lives ( Nokia , 2002 ) .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the

The virus is very contagious thus leading to a rampant spread in the society .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
Thus there is a large demand for the vaccine by the various government bodies .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
Another reason the government bodies is concerned about the development of the new vaccine is the fear for mutation .|||7~8~Prep~with	17~18~Prep~of
As experts have predicted that many more is going to contact the diseases , there is a higher the chance that the diseases will mutate into a stronger virus .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~

During the nine-year development of camera phone technology , we can see that the great market demand , customer requirement , and government regulations of different countries have once affected this technology a lot .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
Actually , a camera phone is a combination of the digital camera and the videophone which can take pictures and save the picture in digital form freely at anywhere and anytime as a digital camera and transfer the pictures or videos to others as a videophone .|||22~23~Nn~pictures	45~46~Nn~videophones
At that time , digital camera and videophone have already become a part of everyday life , people might really want a tool which can let people take pictures freely and transfer them wirelessly .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~
This kind of need of the combination of two technologies eventually bring out the camera phone .|||0~3~ArtOrDet~The	4~5~Prep~for	8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Thus , at 2000 , Sharp launch the world first camera phone J-SH04 which has a 110,000-pixel CMOS image sensor for taking digital photos .|||6~7~Vt~launched
This innovation make sharp achieve a great success .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
We can easily see that the great sales ensured the development of this technology .|||8~8~Vt~have
More and more companies began to realize this great market demand and start researching in camera phones .|||4~5~Vt~have begun	14~15~Prep~on
After integrating the image sensor into the mobile phone , the quality of the pictures taken by the camera phones which only have hundreds of thousands of pixel sensor can not satisfy the need of the consumers .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
The pictures taken by the camera phone are very blurred at that time .|||9~10~Vt~indistinct
What might people need is actually a substitute of the digital camera .|||8~9~Prep~for

From this , we can draw the conclusion that the customer requirement greatly shaped the camera phones technology .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Nn~requirements	12~12~Vt~have
Although the worries of sneak shot have existed since the camera phone came out , it has aroused wide concern during last few years as the increase number of such kind of incidents .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the

Theses above reasons as well as the monopoly market of Hawk-eye together lead to the high cost to use Hawk-eye system .|||11~13~Vt~have led	19~19~ArtOrDet~the
The second limit is the shortcoming of Hawk-eye itself .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Although the Hawk-eye company declared that Hawk-eye is precise and accurate , Hawk-eye made a mistake accidentally .|||4~4~Vt~has	6~6~ArtOrDet~the	13~14~Vt~makes	14~15~ArtOrDet~	15~16~Nn~mistakes

When Andrew Murray knocked the ball out of the bound , Hawk-eye did not recognize it and finally Murray beat Ivan Ljubicic and got in the semifinal .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the	24~25~Prep~into
We use Hawk-eye to prevent errors in judgment ; however , if it does not offer us the accuracy , we may not choose to use it .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
The errors caused by Hawk-eye itself are sure to prevent the potential users from using it and thus , makes the development of Hawk-eye limited .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
In addition , not all the Sportsmen value Hawk-eye system very much .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Even in tennis , one of the sports that Hawk-eye is the most widely used , some of the world 's most popular players still can not accept Hawk-eye system .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the	16~30~Vt~the system is not well accepted by some of the world 's most popular players
Roger Federer and Lindsay Davenport think that Hawk-eye system forgets the true meaning of tennis and makes tennis disinteresting .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
As is widely known , those world-famous players have a great influence on the development of the sport .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~these
If those players do not accept Hawk-eye system , it may be very difficult for Hawk-eye system to develop and spread out further .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , the reasons why Hawk-eye system does not spread out and develop further are the high cost , the weakness of Hawk-eye system itself and the social opposing ideas from some influential world-famous players .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the	23~24~ArtOrDet~the

In summary , the consumption concept that consumption before payment is the main reason of credit cards ' production .|||14~15~Prep~for
From my point of view , two of the main problems are on the government system and people 's minds .|||12~13~Prep~
For example , when somebody or some companies want to apply new techniques into practice , in some certain situations , they had to ask the government for permissions .|||22~23~Vt~have
Because of the officials , this process can cost a long time so that the company lose precious time .|||15~16~Nn~companies
Moreover , if the techniques can bring generous benefit to the company , some officials may use all kinds of excuse to delay or even refuse to give permission until they get bribes from the company .|||8~9~Nn~benefits	20~21~Nn~excuses
In some other cases , in order to protect big companies , officials may prevent new techniques and engineering designs from coming into certain area .|||24~25~Nn~areas

Two problems of the innovation in my country|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
One of them is that the intellectual property rights in China are not protected well ; there are many illegal copy phenomena in China .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
The other problem is that the normal employees in many companies are not valued much by the employers .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
One of the reasons is that the rate of the popularity of computer is much faster than the rate of the increase of consumption level in China , which means that the price of the software is relatively higher than that normal people can accept .|||13~14~Vform~has increased	24~25~Nn~levels	34~35~ArtOrDet~
Subsequently , the inventor of the very software can only get a little profit , which will not impel him or her to continue paying much attention to the innovation .|||28~29~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , illegal copy phenomena restrict the development of the technology in China .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~ArtOrDet~
However , when we change our focus on the enterprises in China , we will find that most of the huge enterprises are public and relied on resources and monopoly .|||25~26~Vt~rely

In conclusion , despite the fact that both skunk work and conventionally created technologies differ in environment where they are being produced , they will still be successful if their creators have the determination and are full of ideas .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the
The birth of new technologies and inventions came about in different forms and through different processes .|||7~8~Vt~come
An example would be in the case of conventionally invented electric cars by General Motors and the first laptop that was invented in a skunk works environment by an engineer from Toshiba .|||4~5~Prep~
The first difference between the two types of innovations is risks involvement and work stress .|||8~9~Nn~innovation
For skunk works environment 's created technology , the person who suggested the innovation has to take very big risks because it is a project of his own , he was not supported by companies , only his own team .|||30~31~Vt~are
As said in Rogers ' article on the 'Birth of laptops ' , Tetstiya Mizoguchi , a Japanese technologist , disobeyed orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development which in the end , he succeed .|||36~38~Vform~was successful

Comparing the two articles written by Rogers , the target group for skunk works prototypes testing usually started small , and then eventually became bigger as more people accept the product ; whereas in the case of conventionally created products , the target group is very large in the beginning due to large scale marketing campaigns .|||28~29~Vt~accepted
The similarity between the innovations created under different environments is that both had wanted to come out with solutions to solve problems that were present .|||12~13~Vt~

In order to survive and develop in the competitive world , it is crucial for not only many countries but also the individuals to fully develop the process for innovations .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
Take China as example ; there are two main problems in hampering the development of innovation .|||10~11~Prep~
First of all , the education system has great effects on the process of recognizing the problems or needs which is the fundamental stage of innovation-development process .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
It is true that the Chinese special education system has excellent achievements in laying the solid foundations of knowledge and skills which are also very important in doing the deeper researches and studies , but the lack of flexibility and creativeness of Chinese education-system is still a big problem .|||30~31~Nn~research	42~42~ArtOrDet~the
As a result , many students get used to accepting the information in the references without thinking and investigating by themselves .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
Consequently , it becomes quite difficult for them to discover the potential problems even when they try to to do it .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~
However , Innovation requires students to develop the ability of discovering problems instead of easily satisfying with the current situations or just following the rules .|||19~20~Nn~situation

In addition to the education problems , the economic development is also one of the important limitations for China .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
Not only the human resources , but also the financial resources have impacts on the development of innovation .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	8~9~ArtOrDet~

However , with the introduction of ICT , many more new jobs are created , large percentage of which are self-employed jobs .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~a
So for the elderly , a new choice is offered to them : after their retirement , instead of heading into the job market and compete with people probably half their age for a post , they can start up their own business .|||25~26~Vform~competing

Furthermore , the country will also lack of trained labor force .|||7~8~Prep~

Besides increasing the number of new jobs , the government can try to invent a new type of job , which can be done by people regardless their age , including the elderly .|||27~27~Prep~of
However , I think there should be a limit on how much shall be spent for the elderly , because government needs to emphasize the money more on country development .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
When the government try to spend more and more for the aged , it will leads to a lack in money for development , then a slower economic growth , which finally leave the government with less choice to spend for the elderly people .|||9~10~Prep~on	15~16~Vform~lead	31~31~Vt~will
Secondly , imposing a limit on public spending for the aged can make people spending money more responsibly .|||14~15~Vform~spend
They therefore will have to think more when spending money , and reducing wasting extra money on unimportant things .|||12~13~Vform~will try to reduce
From the opposing view , many people argue that the aged are the most vulnerable group in the society and thus needing more and more attention .|||21~22~Vform~need
Thus , focusing on social development as a whole , and improving living condition throughout the life of people is actually better way to help people gain a better health and become less vulnerable when they are aged .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~a

Nevertheless , if the government leaves elderly who are fighting old age alone without care , it would be too cruel of the government .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
These unfair treatments that the elderly faced may be pose a psychological problem to them .|||6~7~Vt~face
For example , the old aged face discrimination when finding jobs as compared to the young and also , the old age may receive less all-rounded treatment in healthcare sector based on the stereotype that they are in the natural process of aging and that they are less likely to recover .|||28~28~ArtOrDet~the
If the economic improves , people would earn more money and thus the burden on the children taking care of their old-aged parents would be relatively less as they could better afford the costs of taking care of elderly .|||38~38~ArtOrDet~the
It is also important that ageing related problems are highlighted into the national development and policies for example introduction of the pension system and encouragement of late retirement to reduce elder dependency .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
Information technology applications have enabled elderly to initiate communication , keep track of their personal health record and also make follow-up appointments which can be conducted through Telemedicine .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the

We have seen how technologies were able to replace human supervision and to monitor elderly condition round the clock which was less possible with human care providers .|||5~6~Vt~are	20~21~Vt~is
One may argue that these technologies could potentially isolate the elderly further from their families and keeping them indoors even more .|||16~17~Vform~keep
This is no longer true because advanced technologies had managed to put a face to high tech devices .|||8~9~Vt~have
Furthermore , elderly who have difficulties getting out of their homes can tap on various video technologies to draw themselves closer to their neighbors and faraway relatives by playing chess with them or engaging in a simple conversation .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Instead , it was meant to be a life enabler to increase the quality of life ; like helping the elderly stay indoors safely providing maximum possible social interaction and social support from their neighbors and relatives .|||3~4~Vt~is
These improvements can be seen in various context and we will be looking at the benefits it has provided to the elderly .|||7~8~Nn~contexts
The government created public awareness on early planning and proper saving strategies which are necessary to ensure that we have enough money to last us through our old-age after retirement .|||5~6~Prep~of
However , to some people , especially the younger minds , they disagree with such scheme .|||2~3~Prep~	15~15~ArtOrDet~a
Thus , with the public awareness on saving for old age and the CPF , one will have sufficient savings for their old-age dependency .|||6~7~Prep~of
Therefore , with the development of an elderly-friendly environment , it has helped to ease the aging process .|||2~3~Prep~	11~13~Vt~helps
An elderly is not afraid to walk around the housing estates or travel in public transports as these facilities have become more accessible to them .|||15~16~Nn~transport

Public buses have steps-free entrance and exit for easier mobility of the elderly .|||4~5~Nn~entrances	6~7~Nn~exits
We have a team of well-trained doctors and nurses who are committed to take care of the elderly who needs special attention .|||13~14~Vform~taking
We also have groups of medical specialist who are always finding ways to improve the healthcare of the elderly through better medication and rehabilitation .|||6~7~Nn~specialists
As a result , more day rehabilitation centres and nursing homes are built to handle the demands for increasing healthcare .|||11~12~Vt~have been
The government policies are involved to ensure that proper saving for the future is in place , the upgrading of public facilities have helped create an elderly-friendly environment and the better healthcare services readily available .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~	29~30~ArtOrDet~
Firstly , encouraging later retirement for elderly can drastically change their attitude towards work .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
This in turn will provide a positive mentality to better prepare them in their older age .|||12~13~Prep~for
For example , when the government announced measures to encourage later retirements , the citizens will be prepared for what is to come and will be more readily to accept it and thus reducing elder dependency in the long term .|||6~7~Vt~announces
Secondly , by extending working lives , it will often results in the accumulation of more wealth which can be used to support themselves in the old age .|||2~3~Prep~	5~6~Nn~life	10~11~Vform~result
In addition , it acts as a safety net to dramatically reduce the need for elder dependency .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~This
For example , an elderly who worked for 50 years compared to one that worked for 40 years has considerably more savings .|||6~6~Vt~has	14~14~Vt~has
With the ability to work and also a sustainable income , elderly will find themselves less dependent on others .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
For example , with increased measures from government for putting elderly into the workforce , the elderly will be able to depend on themselves .|||6~7~Prep~by	7~7~ArtOrDet~the	10~10~ArtOrDet~the
All in all , the strategy on reducing elder dependency through the 3 methods can prove to be valuable for an aging society .|||6~7~Prep~of
One example of necessary financial support is the investment on developing and upgrading the current facilities used in education , including information technology equipment , laboratory and library system .|||25~26~Nn~laboratories	28~29~Nn~systems
This is particularly important to developing and less-developed nations ' education , like Vietnam , China , Philippine and Malaysia , where teaching and learning are still following the traditional method with less support by IT and using old textbooks , as well as laboratories with obsolete devices .|||25~28~Vt~still utilise	28~31~Nn~traditional methods
By providing tuition grants ( of 80 % ) and financial aid for living costs for foreign students along with a career bond , Singapore will have a greater workforce serving them for at least 3 years after graduation .|||15~16~Prep~of
Another area that the government needs to concern is the environment as hundreds of environmental projects ( such as reducing the level of green house gases and noxious fumes in the atmosphere or promoting the use of non-plastic carrying bag ) are waiting for capital and fiscal support .|||7~8~Vform~be concerned	39~40~Nn~bags
In such small nations ( in terms of geographical area ) like Singapore , this issue is particularly important because every climatic change or pollution problem is likely to negatively affect the whole country , especially physical health of people , including the aged .|||36~36~ArtOrDet~the	39~39~ArtOrDet~the
Moreover , environment is a global concern ; it influences everybody in the world .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Besides the concerns about environmental protection and education , public spending on the aged should be partly transferred to public infrastructure development projects such as public transportation , schools , hospitals because such developments are directly related to the improvement in living standards of senior citizens .|||41~41~ArtOrDet~the
One example of this could be the extension of access to most public places and even on public transport vehicles for people with physical disabilities , such as designing paths or elevators specialized for wheel chairs , or placing special directions for the elderly with sight or hearing problems .|||4~6~Vform~is
And therefore , to some extents , the elderly will indirectly benefit from this policy .|||5~6~Nn~extent
In conclusion , people may be upset with this idea because they may think that the aged increasingly lack of care from the society .|||19~20~Prep~
However , if considering the positive impacts it brings about the entire society , obviously the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages .|||10~10~Prep~to
As the population continue to age , government spending on the aged would increase as more and more people would rely on the government for their needs .|||12~13~Vt~will
In the past , literacy rate of the people is low .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	9~10~Vt~was
Moreover , most of the money they earned was spent on their children to make sure that they receive proper education .|||18~19~Vt~received
This action of placing the younger generation 's interest before theirs and making sure that they get proper education increases the literacy rate of the country and contributed to the country 's development .|||16~17~Vt~got	19~20~Vt~increased
In other words , the old have contributed a lot into shaping our country to what she is today .|||10~11~Prep~to	14~15~Prep~into
Therefore now that the country has prospered , the government should look after the people who helped made it possible .|||1~1~Vt~,
According to Singapore Ministry of Finance , in FY2009 , 41.5 % of government expenditure would be placed on the economical and social development of the country .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Looking at the numbers , we could tell that sufficient funds have already been placed for the country 's development thus no additional funds are required .|||6~7~Vt~can
A reason for the stand that government should limit spending on the aged is that the aged is not of much use to the society thus the government should not concentrate so much on them .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
Most of the aged proved that they can continue to work and contribute to the society in one way or another thus their welfare should be looked at as well .|||4~4~Vt~have
In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited or diverted as for a developed country like Singapore , many successes are brought about by them and they helped shaped the country to what it is today .|||23~24~Vt~have been	30~30~Vt~have	34~35~Prep~into

To tackle the issue on aging population , The Government has implemented some measures that help the elderly to age comfortably .|||4~5~Prep~of	5~5~ArtOrDet~an	15~16~Vt~are helping
Some of the measures are Medisave , Lift Improvement and Facilities Enhancement for the elderly ( LIFE ) and Eldershield scheme .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
Although this scheme does not provide 100 % coverage on their medical bills , patients will have a lesser burden when majority of the medical bills are heavily subsided by The Government and supported by Medisave .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the
The services include upgrading of lifts to access every floor , installation of support handbars in washroom and setting up Senior Activity Centre in the neighbourhood .|||16~17~Nn~washrooms	20~20~ArtOrDet~a
More attentions should be given to this group of elderly as they have no one to turn to if they require help in their household .|||1~2~Nn~attention
By installing handbars and improving the accessibility of lifts , elderly are now able to move around safely and in better comfort .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
The Senior Activity Centre also provides a place for the lonely old folks to mingle around and to participate in recreational activity .|||21~22~Nn~activities
Thirdly , the Eldershield scheme is introduced since 2007 .|||5~6~Vt~was

In conclusion , the elderly are now more protected and ages more comfortable with the implementation of the policies .|||10~11~Vt~are aging
There are two sides to a coin , although the measures do not solve the problem entirely and may cause inconvenience in some case , the benefits will eventually outweigh the cons .|||23~24~Nn~cases
If a limit is not in place , the government might soon face difficulties with funding other key sectors of the country 's development such as education and defense .|||14~15~Prep~in
This section of public expenditure soaks up a large portion in the government 's annual allocated budget each year .|||10~11~Prep~of
In Singapore 2009 's budget allocation , a total of $ 66 million ( up from a total of $ 55.6 million in year 2008 ) was allocated from the pool of $ 18.1 billion allocated for social development .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
This expenditure is expected to rise further with the increase of life expectancy and the increase in the proportion of elderly ( from 8.6 % in 2008 to 18.7 % in year 2030 ) .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
Quoting a statistic from Singapore 's 2008 budget day report , in 2007 , 21 % of the Government Healthcare Expenditure ( GHE ) , or 0.2 % of the country 's GDP was dedicated to elderly care .|||0~1~Vform~To quote

This is to achieve the balance between each area , where government can set a limit and provide adequate amount spending on them while focusing on other more important aspect like education and so on .|||2~4~Vform~achieves	4~5~ArtOrDet~a	11~11~ArtOrDet~the	21~22~Prep~for	29~30~Nn~aspects
With an increasing number of elderly in the society , it is rather strenuous for the non-elderly to contribute to the tax base .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
However , they should take in consideration that there are elderly from the past generations without good education who have not been able to save in their younger days .|||5~6~Prep~into
One of the reasons , why the government should not be the one that is supporting the elderly , is the simple concept of filial piety .|||14~16~Vt~supports
Filial piety is one of the virtues that have been around society for ages , it emphasises the respect for parents .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
Parents also try to give their children the best education they can afford to .|||13~14~Prep~
Therefore the public spending on the aged should be cut down , because the younger generation should be the one supporting their parents , it is their own duty and should not be left to the government .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
But , there will be special cases , where such aged folk do not have children to rely on , either because they did not have kids , or due to some misfortune resulting in the loss of their children .|||23~24~Vt~do	33~37~Vt~have lost	37~38~Prep~
Hence the public spending on the aged should be limited , but not completely ignored .|||1~2~Nn~
In reality , there are a number of those who try leech off as much government funding as they can , despite their ability to support themselves .|||11~11~Vform~to
Although I believe that people who retire definitely deserve their old age freedom , I completely disagree that most of them are doing it at the expense of the government .|||21~22~Vt~should be
If your children are unable to support you through your old age for whatever reason , you should be trying to find minor jobs to support yourself , especially if you are still physically fit .|||18~20~Vform~try
Therefore the spending on the aged should be lowered , and the smaller amount of funds that are dedicated to it should be given out more wisely and strictly .|||1~2~Nn~
Some people disagree that the public spending on aged should be cut down , and they may say that the cost of supporting an old person may be too much of a burden for the young adult of our world .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~	34~35~ArtOrDet~	36~37~Nn~adults

Also , the funds can be diverted into other sources which will result in an increase of cleanliness in a country .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	16~17~Prep~in
This can be through the form of increased technology , or investment into machinery that clean up the polluted air .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
The cost of supporting and old person is by no doubt majorly due to the increased medical costs that come with old age .|||8~9~Prep~	14~15~ArtOrDet~
Therefore it is the wiser choice to lower the public spending on elderly , because the net benefit from such an action would be much greater than if we were to leave the spending untouched .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~a	8~9~ArtOrDet~	12~12~ArtOrDet~the
This would in turn benefit the country more than if they were to leave the policies untouched .|||6~7~Nn~countries
For instance , in United Kingdom , a research done by Deloitte and summarized by Dr Michael Harris ( Nesta , April 2009 ) , reflected that more than a quarter of fifty to sixty year old elderly people are diagnosed with medical conditions and the numbers are expected to increase in the future .|||39~40~Vt~have been
It is possible for people to have this judgement because this medicine is not widely used in the market as further research is still ongoing to further improve its effectiveness .|||8~9~Vt~view
Moreover , the health conditions such as deteriorating eye sight or poorer hearing can be a problem as well .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
In fact , one of the measures includes the " Maintenance of Parents Act " ( Statutes , " Maintenance of Parents Act " , Chapter 167B , June 1996 ) in which parents can claim their rights from their children who had neglected them .|||42~43~Vt~
Other than that , companies are encouraged to employ older workers even after these workers have past their retirement age ( Channel NewsAsia , September 2009 ) .|||15~16~Vt~are

To sum up , without a doubt diverting public spending from supporting the aged population to the other development in the country may at first seem to be the best option , but eventually , it could in turn result in more harm than good , be it by upsetting the balance of wealth in the country , educating of wrong moral value and conveying the wrong message to its citizen workforce .|||18~18~Nn~areas of	62~63~Nn~values	70~71~Nn~citizens

On one hand , limiting the public spending on the aged does not mean that we can spend less money on the aged .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
At the same time , cutting down public spending on aged will shift the financial pressure to the families with old people .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	16~17~Prep~on	17~18~ArtOrDet~
Therefore , we should not limit the public spending on the aged .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~

Due to this , the public spending on the aged should be limited .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~
If we just cut down the public spending on the aged and divert the money to other areas of the country 's development , this is contrary to the purpose of the government .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~

In conclusion , with proper limitations on public spending on the aged , the excess money can be made to the development of country thus improving its economy conditions .|||23~23~ArtOrDet~the
Aged population will also be encouraged to take care of themselves instead of over-relying on public spending .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The aged
In the modern societies , the aging population is increasing as a truth which can not be denied .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~

As far as I concerned , when the living standard is developed , the incomes of the young people will go up so that they can pay more money to help their parents , who are the aged also .|||4~4~Vform~am
All in all , there are many reasons which support the idea that the spending fee on the aged should be limited .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
Aging , a biological process which every single normal human in this world must experience every day , has become a quite serious problem for some countries in the recent decades .|||28~29~ArtOrDet~
Japan for instance , with its average age of population at 42 in the year 2009 , is having a quite serious problem with aging population .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~an

Although this problem is quite serious , over-emphasizing and spending too much in this problem is not a good idea .|||12~13~Prep~on
These immigrants and well-educated youth , in the long run , can ease the aging problem by becoming the workforce , increasing the size and moving the wheels of the economy and decreasing the elder dependency to the government .|||36~37~Prep~on
On contrast with the earlier education sector which helps in easing the problem by eliminating the cause , an increase in spending in this sector helps by reducing the effects of the old aging population : the collapse of the economy .|||0~1~Prep~In	2~3~Prep~to
Although one can already see from the examples above that spending for the old age should be limited and the fund should be reallocated to other sectors , one might still think that we are in debt to the old age population because of their previous effort and work in the past and that we have to show our gratitude to them by allocating some fund for them , spending too much is still not wise idea .|||65~66~Nn~
On the contrary , spending in other areas might bring benefits as well as solutions for the problem .|||15~16~Prep~to
Spending in education will help in developing the country and eliminating one of the causes of the aging population problem while spending in industrial development will help in attracting immigrants and keeping the economy running .|||1~2~Prep~on	22~23~Prep~on
These examples with the fact that spending for the old age population will not bring any benefit have proven that it is better to limit and reallocate the spending for old age .|||7~8~Prep~on
Just as the aging population is a serious problem , spending for the old age population is also a problem if it is not done properly .|||11~12~Prep~on
On the other hand , spending on the old age should not be too little either as spending too little will cause the population to be upset and therefore decreases the government stability .|||29~30~Vform~decrease

In view of the fact of dramatic increase in national budget spent on the aged , some people suppose that government should limit its expenditure on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
One of the primary reasons why government should not set limits on public spending on older people is the aim to create a higher quality of live for almost everyone .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
And obviously , those of old age should also be provided services such as healthcare , insurance , housing...Thus , there is no reason for government to eliminate its expenditure on this area while many people 's lives can be improved thanks to the support .|||25~25~ArtOrDet~the
Improved healthcare services , subsidies... not only aid the aged in poor financial situations or make their health better but also are the ways people express their respects to the older , which has positive impact on enhancing younger people 's treatment .|||27~28~Nn~respect

To prepare the growing demands of an aging population , countries can build special infrastructure , such as hospitals or apartments , cater to the elderly .|||21~22~Vform~to
This way , specialize and better care can be provided for the elderly .|||3~4~Vform~specialized
In conclusion , current research , development and policy have help to ease the aging process and prepare a country in facing the demand of an aging population .|||10~11~Vform~helped
By creating policy of encouraging elder employment , the elders in the society will be more independent and able to support themselves .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
The growing aged people has bring with many problems including greater pension pressure , increasing medical expenses , and the heavy burden of nursing care for the elderly and so on .|||5~6~Vform~brought
We should do the both ways to make deal with aging problem by making aging both more secure for older generations and less burdensome for younger generations .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
The policy makers have find out many ways to ease the problem .|||4~5~Vform~found
For example , government encourage old people continue to work , and government encourage people to save for their old-age , and encourage young people to product more and so on .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	7~7~Vform~to	12~12~ArtOrDet~the
In this way , it can reduce the burden of the next generation and reduce the spending of government .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
For society , it can support the old people by building charity .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
Thus government should decide on what is essential and should therefore be supported by the public sector , and what should be left to individuals .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
However , governments ' intervention often meant huge spending on medical resources and infrastructure for the elderly , which created many other economic problems such as hindrance of the nation 's economic progress .|||27~28~Prep~to
Reducing funding on the elderly meant that the government have more capital to spend on improving their economy .|||5~6~Vt~means
On the other hand , critics of this notion have argued that with reduced government spending , less educated old folks and those who did not saved enough would be at a severe disadvantage as compared to the rest of the population .|||26~27~Vform~save
Since large amount of money is needed to support an ageing population , governments have to increase their own existing pool of resources to order to generate such amount of capital .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~a
Hence , governments should encourage their normal working population to take responsibility for taking care of their elder parents , through social awareness campaigns .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , new challenges and problems will arise in the future ; hence because of these two reasons , I feel that government should not be too focused on the ageing population issue as there might be other more urgent issues that require their immediate attention in the future .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~the

Although spending on the aged should be limited so that more money can be channelled for the county 's development , we should also make sure that a reasonable portion of annual budget is set aside for them .|||31~31~ArtOrDet~the
Thus , needlessly to say , it is only conscionable to allocate a reasonable sum of money to ensure that their health and well beings are well taken care of .|||24~25~Nn~being

Resultantly , these does not only aid in the nation 's continual progress , it will also enable us to create a competitive edge over our neighbouring countries and also build a strong presence in the financial sector in this region !|||2~3~Nn~this
Nowadays , as the world population is gradually aging , the governments start to adopt a new policy on the public spending .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~
" To some extent , I agree that we agree spend more money on education and environment since investing for country 's development is also a way to invest for the elderly .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
First of all , education should take a higher priority than life of the elderly as investing on education is the inevitable preparation for the next generation .|||17~18~Prep~in
For example , many European countries such as Denmark , Sweden and Cyprus allocate nearly 7 % of their GDP into public investment in education .|||20~21~Prep~for
Consequently , the government will have more money to provide better services of the elderly care .|||12~13~Prep~for
After all , not only the young but the old people will also benefit from the investment on education .|||17~18~Prep~in
Second , government should also divert the money into the environment .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
Adherents who starkly believe that public spending should be focused on the aged often claim that elderly people are not financially protected once they retired from their workplaces .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the	24~24~Vt~are
However , this would be tantamount to saying that government is responsible to " feed " the elderly people in the country once they are unable to get any income .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
While in Italy , the government actually spent a staggering 14.2 percent of the whole nation 's GDP on pension system .|||7~7~Vt~has
Providing a better learning environment for the young generation will yield a better workforce in the future thus bringing more revenue for the government to spend on the elderly people .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~	19~19~Prep~in
Conversely , if the country is not knowledge based , it can hardly make any economic progress due to the lack of understanding of technology development thus leading to shortages in the government 's annual budget for the aged .|||5~6~Vt~were
One typical example is in Singapore where the government spends 20 percent of the nation 's annual budget on educational system which is also one of the key factors that helps the country to progress swiftly throughout the years .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
Another reason why people support the idea of public spending on elderly people is the fact that it 's a natural process for everyone to age .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Imaging living in a country like Sri Lanka where people live in fear everyday with its never ending wars between the local army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore , it is clear that the military development should be ranked with a higher priority as compared to the spending on the aged .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	12~13~Prep~at	19~20~ArtOrDet~
All of these are done as a recognition of what they have contributed to the society for so many years .|||16~17~Prep~over	17~19~ArtOrDet~the
Without making these developments , there 's no way we can ensure that the welfare of the graying generations is met .|||19~20~Vt~will be
One reason that public spending on the aged should be limited is that some of it can be diverted to develop military .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the
According to the World Fact Book 2008 , published by the Central Intelligence Agency , military expenditure from all over the world has increased .|||16~17~Nn~expenditures

If the government keeps giving the elderly money without any limitation , there 's a possibility that the elderly stop to work and just keep depending on the money for living ( evidence ? ) .|||19~19~Vt~would

Developments in Information Technology help to monitor the health conditions of the aged without having the trouble to leave their homes .|||18~19~Vt~leaving
For instance , in Visiting Nurse Services of the Northwest , a homecare organization in Spain , there are home monitoring programs that allows patients to monitor their vital signs and these data are sent back to the nursing home over phone line or satellite for the nurse working in the homecare organization to review the information and to call the patient to tell them about their conditions .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~the
Monitoring programs that make use of technology like the one used by Visiting Nurse Services of the Northwest ease the burden of having to go to a clinic and also saves the trouble for the aged to go through the procedure for medication examination .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the	26~27~ArtOrDet~the	41~42~Prep~of
In addition , in the US , there is a computer program , The Technology Coach , that helps the aged to simplify on the complex procedure on how to take their vital signs such as taking measurement of the glucose level on a step-by-step basis .|||23~24~Prep~
The Technology Coach can even identify the error that they have done during the procedure and notify them on their mistake .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	7~8~Nn~errors	20~21~Nn~mistakes

Over the years , research and development specifically in the field of technology has made significant contribution to address this process of increased inconvenience .|||16~17~Nn~contributions
Although critics of this position point out that technology is still short of significantly slowing aging , current research and development has to a large extend ease this process and make life easier through the introduction of technological inventions .|||26~27~Vt~eased	30~31~Vt~made
Firstly , the current technology of mobile phone and personal device assistance ( PDA ) has in a lot of aspect contribute in addressing issues arising from health and decrease performance in terms of mobility .|||7~8~Nn~phones	20~21~Nn~aspects	21~22~Vt~contributed

To minimize the impact of it , a few suggestion has been proposed , which are increasing money spend on elderly ; cut benefits ; or cut other government spending .|||9~10~Nn~suggestions	18~19~Vform~spent	20~20~ArtOrDet~the
From these solutions proposed , it is very obvious that money spend on elderly currently is predicted not sufficient to cover their need anymore .|||11~12~Vform~spent	13~13~ArtOrDet~the	22~23~Nn~needs
By limiting the money spend on this group of people , it means that lesser amount of money will be used to share among them , whom depends on the public spending to live .|||4~5~Vform~spent
This shows that the suggestion is not going to work as it will cause living problem for the elderly that depends on public spending and at the same time does not help to solve aging issues .|||15~16~Nn~problems
Besides , there is other option available other than cutting the spending on the elderly in order to have more money for other development .|||23~24~Nn~developments
It is normal that tax-payers are very concern on how policy makers make decision on how spend their hard-earn money , whether the policy maker are making full use of it or not .|||7~8~Vt~concerned	13~14~Nn~decisions
Hence , more and more people are suggesting diverting the money to other areas of development , which they think is beneficial to them as compare to spending on the aged .|||25~26~Vt~compared
But , this is definitely not a good suggestion because I believe that government should always put their people as the first priority when making decision .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the	25~26~Nn~decisions
If they were to ignore the needs of the elderly and focus on the development , it will obviously bring more social problem to the society .|||22~23~Nn~problems

I believe this is one of the reason why most elderly refused to see a doctor and accept medical treatment when they are ill because they think that it is a waste of money .|||7~8~Nn~reasons	11~12~Vt~refuse

As for United States government , they divide the spending to five sectors , which are pensions , health , education , welfare and defense .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	16~17~Nn~pension
Due to falling birthrate , I believe it is possible to reduce public spending on education .|||3~4~Nn~birthrates
Low birthrate means that there are lesser students in future , and also , parents to kids ' ratio will higher , these two factors will be two very good reasons to cut down spending on the education sector .|||20~20~Vt~be
From the all the reasons mention above , it is very clear that cutting down public spending for the old age is not a good choice in order to divert the money for the areas of development .|||5~6~Vt~mentioned

Since after the government introduced a campaign " Stop at 2 " to control the high birth rate , it was too successful that the population had been decreasing due to the overwhelming of positive responses by the citizens , thus causing more and more elderly living in this society .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~the	33~34~Prep~
Different types of policies had been introduced to improve the welfare of the elderly so that they are able to benefit from it .|||4~5~Vt~have
One of the policies that had been introduced is the housing policy such as lift upgrading , elderly fitness corner and studio apartments .|||5~6~Vt~has	11~12~Nn~policies
Firstly , the government had implemented the lift upgrading program to build new lifts in the housing blocks which have direct access to every floor to cater to the elderly residents who have painful legs and wheelchair bound .|||4~5~Vt~has	15~16~ArtOrDet~
According to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the old lifts had been replaced with the new lifts which initially only stops at every third or fourth floor .|||12~13~Vt~have	22~23~Vt~stopped

If the society is well-prepared , the younger generation does not have to worry about their own welfare when they turned old .|||20~21~Vt~turn

In conclusion , it is important for the society to be well-prepared for the aging process so that they are able to tackle the issues of aging population that the country will encountered in the future .|||32~33~Vt~encounter
Most importantly , by implementing the different types of policies , it had indeed helped the elderly to meet their needs and are able to engage them in a socially and active lifestyle .|||12~13~Vt~has
For example , according to the Singapore budget report 2009 , the payout for the Senior Citizen Bonus is at least SD $ 73400000.00 for that year .|||9~9~Prep~of
This figure has not yet included the other programme that is proposed for the senior citizens .|||8~9~Nn~programmes
As the source of money for the government is mainly the tax payers , this figure infers a burden to these contributing citizens .|||16~17~Vform~translates as	19~20~Prep~on
In other words , the incomes that they earned would be constantly reduced , more or less .|||5~6~Nn~income
This may grow the feeling of indignation in the tax-payers towards the ruling government - which is not an advantageous condition for the further growth of the country .|||2~3~Vform~result in
Moreover , the over-emphasis in aiding the elders for their sunset years may cause the insufficiency of financial resource in the other part of the country .|||22~23~Nn~parts
If the situation persists for a long term , it will do harm to the nation and may shaken the public trust in the government .|||18~19~Vt~shake
A well-developed country may indirectly even lose competency with the other countries , especially in these few industries , for instance , agriculture , small middle enterprise and so on , that depend on the government funding in many portions .|||26~27~Nn~enterprises
For those developing countries , this will render the effort of the government and the private sectors in the growth of the nation .|||7~8~Vform~affect

Hence , the public funding may indirectly relate with the rising case of abandoned parents at the old folks ' home - for those parents , all the funding seems to have lost its values , if they have lost their connection with their beloved family for it .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
In fact , the public funding for the welfare of the aged ones is still needed in some way , but not so crucial until it should comprise such a huge section of the government spending .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	18~19~Nn~ways
Besides that , most of the elders do have their own savings or investment that they accumulate since they were young .|||16~17~Vt~have accumulated
Anyway , in the case of the three " -less " - homeless , childless and jobless , indeed they should savour the benefit from the eldercare programme by the government .|||23~24~Nn~benefits
( Lee , 2008 ) Aging often becomes terrible as the elderly are drained from high medical and healthcare fee .|||19~20~Nn~fees
On the other hand , there are other crucial areas where governments need to give strong financial supports , such as education and economy .|||17~18~Nn~support
Secondly , in terms of subsidy and medical insurance , the government often fails to differtiate the levels of need among different groups of people .|||19~20~Nn~needs

Therefore , the Government should focus on increasing productivity of future workers and making the citizens more independent rather than how much we should expand the budget .|||24~25~Vt~expanding
Some of the ways to do so is to make saving compelled by law , encourage elderly to come back to workforce , improvement in healthcare aspects .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the

Getting more elderly to get free health screening can ensure health problems to be treated at an early stage thus reducing cost of expensive treatments when symptoms turn serious .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the

But all in all , the advantage of limiting of the public spending overall outweighs the disadvantage as the needy group of people would be minimised .|||9~10~Prep~

Reasons for the government to increase their spending on the elders include , the importance of an elder in a family setting is important and we should all respect them in all aspect .|||32~34~Nn~aspects

It appears that aging population has become the biggest and common concern of the countries all over the world , especially those in Europe and Japan .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
The diverse obstacles associated with aging population creates lots of pressure , ranged not only from medical service but to education system too .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~an	12~13~Vform~ranging
For instance : A survey conducted in British Columbia about the impact of aging population on social services shows that as the average age of citizens increases , so does the health care cost per capita .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~an
They present wireless and mini deaf-aid to enhance the listening ability of elder people as well asartificial limbs for them or walking sticks to aid them standing and walking around.More specifically , designed elevators used for elder people in wheelchairs are everywhere , which plays an important role in helping them going to higher levels in tall buildings .|||36~37~ArtOrDet~the elderly	37~38~Vt~

The next question needs to be debated is : " How much money should the government spend on the medical care for elder people ? " .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
In my opinions , the government should use much more money on taking care of elder people because the following reason : Firstly , the aged are citizens who contributed a lot of money to National Treasury through compulsory taxes like land-tax , income tax...

To reduce the negative impact of aging process , it is therefore important to create a role model for the elderly , eliminate ageism in the society , and improve detection of depression and encouraging lifelong learning .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the

It was noted that the explosion was due to coolant used , which is water , turning to steam and thus , suddenly increased the power produced and nuclear reaction ( World Nuclear Association , 2009 ) .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the	13~14~Vt~was
For the case of the VHTR , helium will be the coolant .|||0~1~Prep~In

There is no doubt that the opponents would not want the history to repeat itself , hence , they would not want nuclear reactors to be built .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	10~11~ArtOrDet~
However , there are important lessons to be learnt from this accident which can be used in improving on the design of nuclear reactors .|||16~18~Vform~to improve	18~19~Prep~
Research and development for VHTR could help to ensure safer operation of nuclear reactor where safety aspects of the reactor would be better than before .|||3~4~Prep~of	4~4~ArtOrDet~the	12~12~ArtOrDet~a	20~21~Vt~will
According to Butler ( 2004 ) , approximately 400 nuclear power plants , each requires about US $ 1 billion , need to be built in order to fully be dependent on hydrogen instead of gasoline .|||14~15~Vform~requiring
In addition , research and testing works are required to look for materials which are able to resist the high temperature of the VHTR and the rapid impact of high energy neutrons in the reaction ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||6~7~Nn~work
Although there might be future technologies which are better than the VHTR , it is not definite as yet .|||7~8~Vt~will be	13~14~ArtOrDet~this
Therefore rather than waiting for a new technology to fully emerge , we should continue to carry out research work on enhancing the feasible technology present now , which is the nuclear reactor .|||3~4~Vform~wait	22~23~ArtOrDet~
Opponents may think that nuclear reactors are potential terrorist targets , but precautions are already taken to minimize the impact .|||13~14~Vt~have
Moreover , nuclear reactors are not the only source for the terrorist ; there are other ways in which terrorists can think of to destroy a country .|||9~10~Prep~of
Therefore , the VHTR can be said to be much safer than nuclear reactors in the past .|||14~15~Prep~of
Lastly , the cost to build and experiment on newly designed nuclear reactors may be high , but the advantage that it can produce more energy with the same amount of resources can far surpass the cost involved as the important issue now is to solve the problem of constantly increasing in energy demand .|||51~52~Prep~
It is mentioned in Butler 's article ( 2004 ) that building VHTR can involve lots of obstacles , but if engineers are able to overcome them , then energy production will be " safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant " .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , I strongly recommend the further funding for the research and development for engineers to overcome the challenges involved in constructing the VHTR .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~	9~10~ArtOrDet~
Talking about the most serious accident ever in the nuclear power history , the 1986 Chernobyl Accident will come to everyone 's mind ( UNSCEAR , 2009 ) .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
According to an authoritative report ( WNA , 2009 ) , there are 56 deaths confirmed to be directly related to the Chernobyl Accident by 2004.It is officially suggested that the Chernobyl Accident was the result of inadequately trained operators , a flawed design , as well as the lack of proper regard for safety ( WNA , 2009 ) .|||15~15~Vform~were	17~18~Vt~have been
As researchers pay more and more attention to applied psychology in the recent decades , people are wondering whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented some major engineering accident like the Chernobyl Accident .|||2~3~Vt~have been paying	16~17~Vt~have been	33~34~Nn~accidents
Evidence shows the use of psychology during the design process would largely reduce the chance of the Chernobyl Accident by raising the awareness of safety culture among the crew .|||11~11~Vt~have	12~13~Vform~reduced
Above all , applying psychology during design process could make people pay more attention to the importance of safety .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
It is identified by International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in the post-accident report that deficient knowledge and awareness of safety through out the design , operating , and regulatory crew was one of the main causes that lead to the Chernobyl Accident ( IAEA , 1992 ) .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	16~16~ArtOrDet~the	25~32~Nn~crews	39~40~Vt~led

And for the regulatory team , they underestimated the potential danger in the nuclear test and therefore did not provide necessary supervision for the test .|||1~2~Prep~	20~20~ArtOrDet~the
( James , 2009 ) All these had contributed to the painful consequence of the Chernobyl Accident , and could be prevented if psychology had been applied to make the crew more responsible and pay more attention to the nuclear safety .|||7~8~Vt~	20~21~Vt~have been	38~39~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore paying more attention to the importance of safety is not enough psychology should be applied to guide the engineers to consider the safety of the nuclear plant from a system level .|||28~29~Prep~at	29~30~ArtOrDet~the
However , as all the other accidents of the same nature namely accidents of the complex high hazard systems the Chernobyl Accident is not the consequence of a single error , but the combination of the failure of various factors ( Wilpert , 2007 ) .|||22~23~Vt~was	32~33~ArtOrDet~a
To prevent the accident , it is important to consider the safety from a macro view by analyzing the whole nuclear system , including the interaction among human , organizational , and technological factors ( Meshkati , 1996 ) .|||1~2~Vt~have prevented	27~28~Nn~humans
On the other hand , not everyone agree with that applying psychology during engineering design process would have prevented the Chernobyl Accident .|||8~9~Prep~	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
First due to the wrong social perception of psychology and the social sciences , many people think psychology is only under the field of human arts and social science , which is totally unrelated to engineering , therefore they think there is no way applying psychology during the designing process will help to prevent those engineering accidents like this Chernobyl Accident .|||54~55~ArtOrDet~	58~59~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore a large part of the safety of the engineering systems lies on human activities .|||12~13~Prep~in
Applying psychology in engineering can help to make people more mature , responsible , and careful while dealing with complex high hazard systems like the nuclear reactors , which will definitely reduce the chance of accident .|||24~25~ArtOrDet~	33~34~Nn~chances	35~35~ArtOrDet~an
Another rebuttal against applying psychology is that some people argue that design errors is the main cause of the major engineering accidents , and applying psychology can not correct these design errors and prevent the accidents .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
It is true that a lot of accidents are due to design errors , but it is also true that human is the factor that gives rise to the accidents in many cases .|||20~21~Nn~humans
If we can not improve the safety awareness among the crew , there is no point to merely solve the technical problem .|||18~19~Vform~solving
For instance , about a decade before the Chernobyl Accident , a nuclear accident occurred at the Three Mile Island , of which the technical cause was also the water cooling system ( WNA , 2001 ) .|||15~16~Prep~on	16~17~ArtOrDet~
The reason of why ten years later the similar technical defect still caused the Chernobyl Accident is because people did not pay enough attention to the nuclear safety and therefore did not learn a lesson from the prior accidents , which is not a pure technical problem and could be solved by applying psychology .|||2~3~Prep~	7~8~ArtOrDet~a	25~26~ArtOrDet~	43~44~ArtOrDet~	49~50~Vt~have been
Human is therefore of vital importance to the safety of engineering design process .|||0~1~Nn~Humans	12~13~Nn~processes
In conclusion , there is adequate evidence shows that the use of psychology during the design process would have largely reduced the chance for the Chernobyl Accident , considering psychology could help to make people pay more attention to the importance of safety and consider the safety of the whole nuclear in the design process .|||7~8~Vform~showing	23~24~Prep~of
Nevertheless , solely applying psychology during design process would not have totally prevented the Chernobyl Accident , because there are other factors that lead to the accident , for example , cultural factor .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the	31~31~ArtOrDet~the

As for construction cost , the supercritical water reactor is rather low .|||0~2~ArtOrDet~The
( Buongiorno & MacDonald , 2003 , p. 3 ) And as for material engineering , according to the corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking ( SCC ) susceptibility tests in supercritical water by scientist from MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) and the University of Michigan ( J. McKinley , S. Teysseyre , G. S. Was , D. B. Mitton , H. Kim , J-K Kim , and R. M.

On the other hand , as for the Very High Temperature reactor , big safety provisions have to be considered to ensure the stability under high temperature and a multitude of coolants are needed .|||26~27~Nn~temperatures
Since the coolant for VHTR is inherit gas such as Helium and is not recyclable , a lot of energy and money will be consumed to separate it from air .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	6~6~ArtOrDet~an
Moreover , large amount of money needs to be spent to design and develop new related materials which can bear high temperature , high { neutron } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron ] dose , and { corrosive } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion ] operating conditionsinside the VHT reactor ( IAEA 2004 ) .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~a	21~22~Nn~temperatures	34~35~Nn~doses
However , SCWR can be installed not only in shorter period but also by fewer workers , which will dramatically save the fixed costs of plant construction .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	8~9~Prep~within	9~9~ArtOrDet~a
In the meantime , the supercritical water reactor can also enjoy high thermal efficiency and energy conversion rate .|||8~11~Vt~also enjoys	15~15~ArtOrDet~a
And compared with Very High temperature reactor , the SCWR is a breeder one , thus it could produce more usable potentially usable fuel , which means less core material such as Uranium would be consumed to produce same quantities of electricity .|||3~7~ArtOrDet~the VHTR	38~38~ArtOrDet~the
Lastly , compared with VHTR , owing to its lower temperature , the SCWR needs fewer heats to trigger the reactions and keep the thermal inertia , which save more energy but also stay in the high thermal efficiency .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	16~17~Nn~heat
Since SCWR is a combine and expanse of old Light Water reactor and fossil fuel fired boiler , which are commonly deployed and widely used around the world .|||8~12~ArtOrDet~the old Light Water Reactor	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Thus the basic theories and technologies for SCWR have been proven to be reliable for many years ( W. S. Yang , N. Zavaljevski ,2003 ) .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
But as for VHTRs , not a similar plant has been build yet ( the first VHTR will be completed in 2020s ) , a lot of new and untested concepts still need be verified , which may cause reactors with more nondeterminacies any incur more unexpected problems .|||11~12~Vform~built	21~22~Nn~2020
And as for VHTR , a lot technical challenges also remain to be unsettled .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
However , since SCWR 's simple and user-friendly design , almost from mature technologies of LWR ; therefore it will be more likely to be adapted soon by many countries , especially those developing countries without strong capital and mature technologies .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	15~15~ArtOrDet~the	19~21~Vt~is
Moreover , by processing electricity , hydrogen also can be generated with electrolysis by SCWR , which will support the development of hydrogen industry in following decades and make additional profits .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the	22~22~ArtOrDet~the	25~25~ArtOrDet~the
Different from Light Water Reactors used around world today , the Super Critical Water Reactor can be more likely to slow down and catch 'fast neutrons ' , which means it would burn less nuclear fuels in a more thorough way .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	15~17~Vt~is
So the time for breakdown nuclear wastes will be decades instead of millenniums after SCWR will be applied .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the	15~17~Vt~is
Further , compared with VHTR , the primary and secondary coolant of SCWR is just the same supercritical water which can be relatively easy to get and recycled .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	12~12~ArtOrDet~the	27~28~Vform~recycle
And because the super enthalpy of supercritical water , more energy will be transplanted but less unexpected by-products will be produced , which will certainly decrease the risk of contamination to the environment and enhance the integral efficiency of transplanting , which will effectually reduce the carbon emissions by burning less fossil fuels .|||45~46~ArtOrDet~
The safety of SCWR has been proven and can be better in the future .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
Thanks to the improvement of core design , less average core density will be required so that the possibility of devastating accidents such as core melting down happened will become extremely slim ; And because the dedicated moderator of SCWR , the boiling crisis of coolants under normal operating conditions can be also eliminated .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	24~24~ArtOrDet~the	39~39~ArtOrDet~the
Since the SCWR safety system is comparable with ABWR , scientists now are trying to combine SCWR with ESBWR-type passive safety systems together .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the
If it can be integrated together , the safety of SCWR will be enhanced dramatically .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
To conclude , although some technical issues of Super Critical Water reactor are still under researching , personally I reckon that the SCWR would be the most promising reactor against other generation ones , in terms of performance , cost , feasibility , and impacts to the environment .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	14~16~Vform~being researched	44~45~Nn~impact	45~46~Prep~on

In conclusion , I support the notion of the research and development of nuclear power plants .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
Some argue that it is too costly to build and that they should adopt other renewable energies rather than nuclear power ( Totty , 2008 ) , while others argue that developing countries do not have enough skilled labours to cope with the demanding needs of building and operating nuclear reactors ( Squassoni , 2009 ) .|||38~39~Nn~labour
Although there is much opposition to the idea of building nuclear reactors in developing countries , there is some evidence that building nuclear reactors , such as the Generation IV reactors , yields positive outcomes to the countries .|||35~36~Prep~for	36~37~ArtOrDet~these
Alternatively , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Mohamed ElBaradei , proposed that these countries could construct hundreds of small-scale plants for a single town ; each one built using a fraction of the cost used for a large-scale plant and without using expensive power grid ( Bullis , 2005 ) .|||45~46~Nn~grids
As a result , opponents maintained that building nuclear reactors would not address the problem of unemployment ( Squassoni , 2009 ) .|||5~6~Vt~maintain
In summary , developing countries should develop the nuclear reactors for several reasons .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
In addition , new design of reactor will only be approved if it presents a relatively lower construction costs .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~a	18~19~Nn~cost
Moreover , if developing countries have insufficient funds , they can approach AEHI for financial and labour support but an alternative way would be building smaller-scale plants without the need to use costly power grid and thus , incurring lower costs .|||34~35~Nn~grids
Therefore , in my opinion , developing countries should first provide huge funding to build generation IV reactors in order to combat unemployment and poverty in the rural areas .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~
According to Butler , 2009 ; butler states in his article that researchers have been pondering on the decision to use the nuclear funding for the development of generation ( IV ) reactors , which are projected to be better than the current generation ( II ) and ( III ) reactors , or retain the nuclear funding for existing generation ( II ) and ( III ) reactors .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~
Although there are reasons that seem to support the funding of the SCWR , the development of the SCWR should not be funded as there are other factors like economic and social feasibility to consider before we can conclude that the funding for the development of SCWR should be approved .|||46~46~ArtOrDet~the
One of the many reasons given to support the claim for SCWR funding is that SCWR is the combination of two proven technologies which are Light water moderated reactors ( LWRs ) and supercritical-water fossil plants ( Buoniorno , 2002 ) .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the	17~18~ArtOrDet~a
Hence , Supporters of SCWR claim that SCWR would have a reduced capital cost as a result of plant simplification and high thermal efficiency .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Although I concur with their view , they had overlooked the problem of SCWR being capable of reaching the commercialization process of an innovation ( Rogers , 2003 ) .|||8~9~Vt~have	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
The likelihood of SCWR reaching the commercialization process is low because , even though SCWR is the combination of two proven technologies , research is still required to merge the two technologies together .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the	14~14~ArtOrDet~the
Furthermore , the simplification of SCWR involves the usage of materials that are either expensive , rare , or do not exist ( Absolute astronomy , 2009 ) .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
This reinforces the possibility that the SCWR can not enter the commercialization stage of innovation , proving that there should not be funding for the development of SCWR .|||27~27~ArtOrDet~the
Another reason proponents give is SCWR uses water which is cheap and easily obtainable as a coolant ( Butler , 2009 ) .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
In addition , supporters of SCWR also state that SCWR take up less space than current Generation ( II ) and ( III ) Reactors ( MacDonald , 2003 ) .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	9~9~ArtOrDet~the
I have to acquiesce to the two points raised by the followers of SCWR .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
However , these two arguments brought up by the opposition did not consider that both water and space are vital to mankind .|||10~11~Vt~do
This implies that funding should not be channeled for the development of SCWR .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Instead , funds could be directed to the development of Very High Temperature Reactor ( VHTR ) which utilizes helium which is not important for human survival as helium is not found in human body ( the encyclopedia of earth , 2008 ) .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the	33~33~ArtOrDet~the
Second , although the land required to build the SCWR is less than the existing reactors , the area needed to build new SCWR would be better utilized as area for agriculture especially in the future .|||22~22~ArtOrDet~a
Therefore , there should not be funding for the development of SCWR as SCWR utilizes two key ingredients for human survival .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the	13~13~ArtOrDet~the
The last reason that advocates for funding of the development of SCWR provide is the building of SCWR that could generate excellent jobs for the society ( Nuclear Energy Institute , 2009 ) .|||5~6~Prep~	7~8~Prep~for	11~11~ArtOrDet~the	17~17~ArtOrDet~the

This indicates that a job loss of around 1500 is incurred .|||9~10~Vt~will be
After considering both sides of the arguments , it is evident that there should not be funding for the development of SCWR as there are more shortcomings than the yields .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~the	28~29~ArtOrDet~
First is that the funding for the development of SCWR can be channeled to more pressing issues like eliminating poverty and food shortage .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Next , the possibility of SCWR surviving the commercialization stage is low .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
Lastly , the benefits that the researchers had predicted are not totally beneficial to human .|||14~15~Nn~humans

Subsequently , various groups of experts from the nuclear and chemical industry investigated into this case , and some of them came into a conclusion that the most essential way to prevent such catastrophe from happening again lied in the enhancement of psychological education to people ; whereas the others opposed that the main problem was actually the design failures of the plant , and the prevention could hardly be simply regarded as a psychological issue .|||11~12~Nn~industries	14~15~ArtOrDet~the	22~23~Prep~to	23~24~ArtOrDet~the	33~33~ArtOrDet~a	42~42~ArtOrDet~the	44~45~Prep~of	48~49~ArtOrDet~

I have to grant the truth that sometimes , faults of technical factors devalue and constraint psychological education effectiveness , however , the engineering deficiencies in this case are actually design errors ; in other words , they are probably manual errors due to carelessness or misses of considerations .|||28~29~Vt~were	38~39~Vt~were

In recognizing the three main problems as the operators ' unawareness , designers ' misses of considerations and politicians ' arbitrariness , the aid of psychology should be highly appreciated as an efficient way to minimize the human errors , and thus to prevent such accident from happening again .|||36~37~ArtOrDet~	45~45~ArtOrDet~an

Both LFR and VHTR have their advantages and disadvantages over the other in terms of performance .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	3~3~ArtOrDet~the
The VHTR will be operating at temperatures 900 to 1000 degree Celsius .|||10~11~Nn~degrees
Even though LFR is estimated to have a comparatively lower efficiency in energy generation than VHTR ( Chapin , et al. , 2004 ) , it is more suitable in certain countries due to its flexibility in its scale of operation .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	15~15~ArtOrDet~the
( Idaho National Laboratory , 2007 ) Also , researches have shown that LFR will also be able to generate hydrogen ( Bouchard , et al , 2008 ) .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , it is evident that though LFR is predicted to be poorer in terms of efficiency as compared to VHTR , LFR seems more useful and suitable for many countries due to its other features .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	20~20~ArtOrDet~the	22~22~ArtOrDet~the
Also , the reactor will be using helium as coolant which is costly as helium is a rare gas in the atmosphere .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~a coolant ,
On the other hand , it is roughly estimated that the smaller plant of LFR can be designed , constructed and operated for 15 years for less than $ 700 million .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
In addition , the development of small LFR will incur smaller research and demonstration costs , since the technology base can be applied to later LFR concepts on building larger reactors .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
( Idaho National Laboratory , 2007 ) On the whole , it seems that lead-cooled fast reactors are much cheaper to build than VHTR .|||23~24~Nn~VHTRs
At such high temperatures , there is higher possibility of a dangerous melt-down of the reactor .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a
Also , as its fuel cycle is closed , there is no need for offsite emergency response - the system will shut down without spreading radioactive materials .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~an
Therefore , LFR seems a safer reactor as compared to VHTR .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	10~10~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , there are still uncertainties in the features of the reactors ; it is not certain that LFR will still have these advantages over VHTR after the completion of designs of the plants .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the	25~25~ArtOrDet~the	30~30~ArtOrDet~the
However , from the theoretical point of view , after looking at the advantages LFR has over VHTR in theory , I believe that LFR will be a better reactor than VHTR with its predicted flexibility in its scale of operation , low cost and better security .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the	17~17~ArtOrDet~the	24~24~ArtOrDet~the	31~31~ArtOrDet~the
Hence , more funds should be allocated towards the research of LFR .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Within the past half century , two major accidents at the Chernobyl and the Three Mile Island nuclear power plants had caused the public to have a negative view on the operation of nuclear reactors and also , the future of nuclear energy generation .|||20~21~Vt~have	29~30~Prep~of
Presently , the most common energy source , which is the coal-fired power generation , has been causing detrimental effects on the environment by releasing tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases ; and subsequently , causing rise to global warming .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	35~35~ArtOrDet~a	36~37~Prep~in
In 2001 , the Generation IV International Forum has introduced six different generation IV nuclear reactor concepts which have been designed in such a way that when accidents occur , the damage will be contained ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||8~9~Vt~	18~19~Vt~had
For example , the accident which occurred at the Three Mile Island did not involve any deaths or injuries as the radioactive particles were successfully contained within the reactor itself ( Yousefzadeh , 2007 ) .|||7~8~Prep~on
This simply shows that with advanced technology , even though an accident-free nuclear plant may never be achieved , at least the technology incorporated into the reactor system would be able to ensure that radiation is contained in times of accident .|||40~41~Nn~accidents
Hence , with more funding directed towards the research and development of LFR , it may one day become one of the safest forms of energy generation .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Critics also claim that nuclear power plants and nuclear waste can be potential terrorist targets as a great extent of damage can be done when the plants are being attacked or exploited .|||28~29~Vt~
Another factor to be considered is the sustainability of LFR .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , LFR has much to offer to mankind especially in terms of safety , security , sustainability as well as environmental effects .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
LFR is a nuclear energy reactor that is environmentally friendly with zero greenhouse gas emission .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The
The US administration though , recognizes the potential of nuclear energy and has committed US $ 40 million to support Research & Development ( R&D ) for Next Generation Nuclear Plants ( NGNPs ) ( DOE , 2009 ) .|||5~6~Vt~has recognized
The slow but fatal effects of radiation have made radiation leak from nuclear reactors a major safety concern among the public .|||10~11~Nn~leaks
Another safety feature of VHTR is the use of uranium fuel pellets multi-coated with graphite .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
These reinforced pellets are extremely heat resistant and do not crack easily , so even in a case of a meltdown , the uranium pellets will be able to retain the radiation and fission products within its core with minimal release to the surroundings ( CHM333 , 2007 ) .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~the
Moreover , the high operating temperature of VHTR also results in higher fuel burn-up ratio of the fissionable materials in the uranium pellets ( DOE , 2008 ) .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
However , additional funding for VHTR will only be available if both the US government and public can be convinced about the viability of NGNPs replacing coal and gas power plants as the main supplier of US electricity .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	16~16~ArtOrDet~the
To achieve this , the VHTR has to stay on track through sustained R&D work in the coming years so that it can meet its expected delivery deadline on 2020 ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||28~29~Prep~in

Many countries rely on fossil fuels as their source of energy and fossil fuel is known to be the major contributor to the green house gases .|||21~22~Prep~of	22~23~ArtOrDet~

Energy- related carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of petroleum , coal , and natural gas had contributed to eighty-two percent of total U.S. anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2006 ( Energy Information Administration , 2008 ) .|||16~17~Vt~
By using the very high temperature reactor ( VHTR ) , hydrogen can be used as the fuel of the future replacing the fossil fuels .|||21~22~Vform~to replace	22~23~ArtOrDet~
In addition , more electricity is being produced with the help of the VHTR .|||5~7~Vt~will be
VHTR plants are able to produce hydrogen for fuel using high-temperature steam electrolysis , which breaks apart the bonds of water molecules ; this process is 50 percent more energy-efficient as compared to the existing hydrogen production methods ( Svoboda , 2009 ) .|||33~34~ArtOrDet~
With VHTR , developing countries will be able to meet their energy demand and will thus lift millions of people out of poverty .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
Therefore , similar to those rich countries , developing countries should also provide funding to the development of VHTR .|||14~15~Prep~for	18~18~ArtOrDet~the
However , given memories of the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and of 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , during which the reactor core exploded , killing some 31 people instantly and spreading radioactive debris across Europe ( Butler , 2004 ) , the public is concerned about the safety of the VHTR .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~the
Nuclear reactors would then become less of terrorist target .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a
VHTR also has safety features to prevent core overheating and the release of radioactive material , in hope that these new approaches will eventually erase the memory of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl ( Svoboda , 2009 ) .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The
Building of VHTR means that countries will no longer need to depend on fossil fuels for source of energy and the emission of greenhouse gases will also be greatly reduced .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the	15~16~Prep~as	16~16~ArtOrDet~a
It is evident that the countries should go ahead with the research and development of VHTR .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~	15~15~ArtOrDet~the
Developing countries should also invest in the development of VHTR as satisfying their energy demand is essential for their economic growth .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Nevertheless , the public , referring to the entire world population , has always been concerned about the safety and security issues of these nuclear reactors .|||23~24~ArtOrDet~
Thus , researchers came out with generation four reactors concepts hoping to ease the public 's worries .|||3~4~Vt~have come
I personally support the molten salt reactor concept for further research and development based on the following factors , safe operation of the plant , global security and the cost efficiency .|||28~29~ArtOrDet~
Radioactive emission can be from nuclear explosion or nuclear waste .|||1~2~Nn~emissions	6~7~Nn~explosions	9~10~Nn~wastes
Explosion of the nuclear reactor during operation is due to either high temperature or high pressure .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~An explosion	2~3~ArtOrDet~a
Nevertheless , Forsberg ( 2006 ) stated that the MSR has a strong negative temperature coefficient .|||6~7~Vt~states
Thus when there is an increase in temperatures , the fuel-salt density will reduce and push fuel out of the reactor core into critically safe , passively cooled tanks .|||7~8~Nn~temperature
This will prevent overheating which leads to explosion .|||7~8~Nn~explosions
He also added that MSRs operate at steady-state condition , with minimum excess nuclear reactivity .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a
Besides safety issues , security of the nuclear reactors is another point brought up by opposition .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
The existence of nuclear reactors provides the terrorists an ideal bombing location .|||3~5~ArtOrDet~a nuclear reactor	6~7~ArtOrDet~
Plus , in molten salt reactor , plutonium , a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapons , is actually created during the process before it is being reprocessed .|||5~6~Nn~reactors	26~27~Vt~
Opposition feared that the plutonium might be stolen by terrorists to make nuclear weapons .|||1~2~Vt~fear
However , Idaho National Laboratory ( 2005 ) claimed that the plutonium content remained in the salt and has high critical mass that makes it less desirable to be used in weapons .|||8~9~Vt~claims	13~14~Vt~remains
According to Butler ( 2004 ) , supporters are also positive that plutonium obtained could be spiked with other chemicals or elements to make it too hot to steal .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the	14~15~Vt~can
This further supports the need for research and development on molten salt reactor .|||12~13~Nn~reactors
As for the risk of malign intent , World Nuclear Association ( 2008 ) stated that the basis of the design of the reactors assumed these threats .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the	14~15~Vt~states	24~25~Vt~assumes
World nuclear association ( 2009 ) stated that the cost of nuclear power generation has declined since 1990s .|||0~3~ArtOrDet~The World Nuclear Association	6~7~Vt~states	17~17~ArtOrDet~the
In addition , Thornley ( 2009 ) claimed that , as compared to other energy sources , that the nuclear energy has the highest average capacity factor .|||7~8~Vt~claims	18~19~ArtOrDet~
Taking MSR as an example , previous design for MSR used steam cycle for electrical production .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	7~8~Nn~designs	9~9~ArtOrDet~the	12~13~Nn~cycles
Current proposal uses the Brayton cycle which has advantages such as lower cost and improved efficiency .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~The current

Thus , there are doubts on whether MSR is a good choice .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~about	7~7~ArtOrDet~the
Nevertheless , currently there is the carbon-based material which according to Forsberg ( 2006 ) is compatible with molten salt at high temperature .|||22~23~Nn~temperatures

The train company , InterCity Expss ( ICE ) , had received complaints regarding the original train wheels causing serious resonance and tremor whilst travelling at high velocity .|||22~23~Nn~tremors
Even after the conductor had verified the problem , he still outright refused to stop the train and insisted to adhere to company regulations .|||20~21~Vform~adhering
It is shocking to realize that this unique policy that ICE complies to differs from the traditional 'stop and examine ' one .|||12~13~Prep~with
This accident could perhaps be averted if the conductor had used his personal judgment and halted the train when an unexpected problem was discovered .|||4~5~Vt~have been
It must have been pressure from the organizational management that made the conductor follow ICE orders and refuse to do what is right i.e .|||21~22~Vt~was

After conducting a root cause analysis on the accident , a psychologist could perhaps aid the company by vetting the flawed regulations to grant train conductors the power to make an assessment to stop the train should he receive any complaints from passengers .|||14~15~Vt~have aided
This proved that checks were only on the external structure of the train and not on the internal hardware and sustainability of the wheels to support the train 's weight .|||1~2~Vt~proves	6~6~Vt~conducted

Hence the treatment of nuclear waste will be a major public concern .|||6~8~Vt~is
According to 'Nuclear power 's new dawn ' published on Nature , '96 % of spent fuels consist of uranium and plutonium ' in other words more fuels can be generated if the wastes are to be reprocessed .|||9~10~Prep~in
In addition , as the design is a fast neutron reactor , it produces excess neutrons which can be used to transmute the nuclear waste to isotopes of shorter half-lives , reducing the toxicity of the waste .|||25~26~Prep~into
This design also addresses a security concern of nuclear waste reprocessing .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~the
Currently , in the logistics of reprocessing , nuclear wastes are transported to reprocessing facilities which recovers the uranium and plutonium before sending them to another mixed oxide fuel ( MOX ) reactors to be burnt as fuels .|||32~33~Nn~reactor

Global warming has become a concern to people due to its high emission of greenhouse gases from the energy usage .|||17~18~ArtOrDet~
To reduce the carbon dioxide emission , a new energy source , which can provide sufficient energy with least emission of greenhouse gases , should be considered since the energy needs is rising in every country .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~the
Nowadays , the engineers and industrial people are very interested about nuclear energy which can provide up to 80 % of the electricity in France ( Butler , 2004 ) in cost-effective way with mass production .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	10~11~Prep~in	31~32~ArtOrDet~a cost effective
According to a research , the accidents caused by nuclear plants are much less than those of other accidents like traffic , suicides and fire .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
The Generation IV International Forum ( GIF ) , a research and development group organized by ten nations to carry out the next generation nuclear energy , is identifying and selecting six nuclear energy systems with variety of reactors , energy conversion systems , and fuel cycle technologies .|||36~36~ArtOrDet~a
With GIF 's nuclear technology , the concerns of public mentioned above would be solved .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
Among the six generation IV reactor concepts , the most advanced concept is VHTR ( very high temperature reactor ) which is a more efficient way of energy conversion of heat to electricity and can provide 50 % more energy from the same amount of fuel compared with other conventional nuclear plants .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
Regarding nuclear power plants , safety features of the plant is the highest priority concern of the public .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the
There were nuclear accident hazards all over the world in a few decades ago , for example , the reactor core explosion at Chernobyl in Ukraine , killed many people , two people died in the initial explosion while other deaths resulted from radiation poisoning ( Gramling , 2009 ) .|||9~10~Prep~	31~31~Prep~with	33~34~Vform~dying	41~42~Vform~resulting
The VHTR system has its own safety features such as very high system temperature , enhanced goals for safety and reliability , low decay heat load , low power density with easily coolant geometry and so on ( Idaho National Laboratory ) .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~a
The core is composed of non-combustible nuclear grade graphite which has a very stable structure even at high temperature and high heat capacity .|||18~19~Nn~temperatures
Moreover , the additional safety features such as how to minimize the damages and protect lives if accident occurs will also be developed further ( Lee , 2005 ) .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	11~12~ArtOrDet~	12~13~Nn~damage	17~17~ArtOrDet~an
As VHTR operates at very high temperature , there are fewer wastes to reprocess than those of other systems .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	4~4~ArtOrDet~a
The reprocessing will cut off 96 % of the nuclear waste produced which consists of plutonium and uranium and only about 1 % of long- lived element is left as residue .|||26~27~Nn~elements
There are also additional steps of process to convert those long-lived wastes into element with shorter half- lives , i.e .|||13~14~Nn~elements

Nuclear terrorism has always been a threat to the world since the sudden attack in Hiroshima in 1945 .|||14~15~Prep~on
Since VHTR is still in the way of research , the earliest delivery will be in 2020 ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
With the qualified security system developed , the nuclear terrorism can be prevented .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
In conclusion , in view of the increasing need for more energy globally , nuclear energy will become essential in the future once its negative aspects such as safety issues , waste management and potential exploitation of plutonium proliferation by terrorists can be controlled .|||41~43~Vt~are
This , in fact , has become possible after the development of VHTR which incorporates the new features to minimize the risks of accidents and enable safer disposal of nuclear waste .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the

With promises of lower cost , lesser waste and a safer alternative , it may seem that Nuclear power with introduction of generation IV reactors such as the super-critical-water- cooled reactors is the next generation of power plants .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
But these promises are empty promises if one would look deeper into the issue of Nuclear Power .|||8~10~Vt~looks
The cost of the nuclear plant can be divided into 3 main parts : Capital cost , Operating cost and Fuel cost .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~a
It is claimed that the capital cost of the nuclear power plant is $ 9 / MWh which is the same for the coal plant and very low fuel cost of $ 5 / MWh as compared to $ 11 / MWh for the coal powered one .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~a	22~23~ArtOrDet~a	30~31~Prep~at

These wastes are radioactive with very long half life .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~a
Full disposal of it will incur very high long run costs which are often not factored into the operation cost of the plant .|||21~22~ArtOrDet~a

However , development in the technology used by nuclear reactors are still on-going with the recent introduction of Generation-IV nuclear reactor concepts , one of them being the molten salt reactor .|||3~4~Prep~of

In addition , the operating temperature allows a range from 550 to 800 degrees .|||9~10~Prep~of
On top of that , lead which is used as the main source is less reactive metal compared to sodium for sodium-coaled fast reactors .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~a
Moreover , another opposing view is that the cost for building a nuclear plant is rather high .|||9~10~Prep~of
Furthermore , the cost for mining out and transporting the coal and fuel is also very expensive due to their scarcity whereas the sources for nuclear power plant are much cheaper since plenty of uranium can be extracted from the earth 's crust .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	27~28~Nn~plants
Hence , in the long run , it is more economical to adopt lead-coaled fast reactor which is also an environmental source of energy .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the

With all this concerns on the use of nuclear power , it seems that nuclear power poses more of a problem than a beneficial energy source .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~these
However , with the building of generation IV reactors such as VHTR , problems that the old Generation reactors faced will be greatly reduced , making nuclear power an essential energy source .|||11~11~ArtOrDet~the
Regarding to the safety concerns , opponents of nuclear power might argue that nuclear reactors are potentially dangerous as the effects from any nuclear accidents would be disastrous to both the environment and the people .|||24~25~Nn~accident

Consequently , many countries have regarded VHTR as the energy for the future , because it produces hydrogen gas as a complimentary energy source that is reusable .|||10~11~Prep~of

Engineering Psychology is concerned with adapting the equipment and environment to people , based upon their psychological capacities and limitations ( Blum , 1952 ) with the objective of improving overall system performance ( involving human and machine elements ) .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the

Never the less , someone hold the opinion that if technology improves enough , we could get rid of the accident without applying psychology in the design processes .|||19~21~Nn~accidents	25~26~ArtOrDet~

Through a survey , 92 % of all significant events in nuclear utilities between 1983-1984 were caused by people and of these only 8 % were initiated by the control room operator ( Stanton.N , 1996 ) .|||13~14~Prep~in	25~26~Vt~had been

And the result is making production process more comfortable and safer but not totally preventing the accident .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~the	14~15~Vform~prevent	15~17~Nn~accidents

On 26 April 1986 , a catastrophic disaster , which destroyed the city and killed 30 people in few seconds , fell on Chernobyl .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~a
Massive amount of radioactive substances spread , and eventually caused approximately 270000 cancer cases and 93000 fatal cancers ( Greenpeace , 2006 ) .|||1~2~Nn~amounts

Most of the studies have shown that it was the carelessness of the operator and large amount of design errors which lead to the disastrous explosion .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~a	21~22~Vt~led

Although engineering psychology may not be able to detect all the errors , the methodology used throughout the process would definitely point out some of the erroneous part .|||5~6~Vt~have been	21~22~Vt~have pointed	27~28~Nn~parts
According to Noyes ( 1997 ) , most of the accidents occurred due to large amount of errors , and elimination of each of the errors could effectively prevented the accident .|||28~28~Vt~have
For instance , the control rods used in the exploded Unit 4 reactor , which served to slow down the reactions , are made of boron carbide with graphite tips .|||22~23~Vt~were

However , the study of Jacques ( 2000 ) stated that it was the dictatorship of Soviet Union , rather than technical incompetence , which brought the Chernobyl accident .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the	26~26~ArtOrDet~about
In fact , the scientists in Soviet Union were equipped with deep technical knowledge , but they were more motivated to produce nuclear weapon for self interest .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the	23~24~Nn~weapons

There are fears that the reactor may get overheated as it operates at very high temperature .|||15~16~Nn~temperatures

There are skeptics who argue that high start up cost , due to the materials of the reactor , make the VHTR not worth undergoing further research and development .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the

Furthermore , in-depth investigations revealed that before the night of accident , the maintenance crew did not carry out their maintenance jobs properly .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~the
From the feedbacks they received from customers , the company said that passengers could hear loud vibrations in dinnerware and glasses were moving across the table when the train is moving at cruising speed ( Eschede , N.D. ) .Thus , the engineers were tasked to come up with a new design to solve problem .|||2~3~Nn~feedback	17~18~Prep~	29~30~Vt~was

First and foremost , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor ( SWCR ) has good security system and is safe to be used.TS Much have been said about the danger of using nuclear reactors as power generators such as emission and leakage of radioactive waste and explosion of nuclear reactor , where Chernobyl and Three Mile Island emerge to be famous for that reason .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~The	10~10~ArtOrDet~a	20~21~Vt~has

Last but not least , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor ( SWCR ) has high efficiency in term of electricity and power generation.TS According to Nuclear Engineering and Design ( 2007 ) , Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor ( SWCR ) promises to have high thermal efficiencies of approximately 45 % , which can generate about 1,700 MWe of thermal energy per hour .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~The	30~30~ArtOrDet~The

Since that VHTR uses lower amount of fuel to produce higher amount of energy , it is much more economic than other power plants regardless the start up cost , as the start-up cost can be compensated in the long run .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
Therefore , when sources of conventional plants are severely depleted , its cost will soar up high and become uneconomical ; on the other hand , VHTR uses half the amount of fuel to produce equal amount of energy , hence it can last longer .|||35~35~ArtOrDet~an
VHTR is coated with a layer of graphite which can be used to slow down neutrons in order to control the nuclear chain reaction and it is covered with ultra hard ceramic layer .|||29~29~ArtOrDet~an

In short , operating at 1000 degree Celsius is not much of a safety issue since VHTR is safe and reliable at high temperature .|||23~24~Nn~temperatures
However , there are other factors that will also affect the cost of operating the reactor , such as maintenance cost .|||20~21~Nn~costs
With the economic production of hydrogen ( H2 ) by thermochemical cycles , it can reduce the maintenance cost for operating the VHTR .|||0~1~Prep~
However , recycling of nuclear waste will result in the production of plutonium , which can be used as nuclear weapon ( Butler .|||20~21~Nn~weapons
Hence , recycling of nuclear waste is not safe in term of security .|||10~11~Nn~terms
VHTR generates electrical energy in two ways , from nuclear reactant directly and from hydrogen fuel .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the
In conclusion , VHTR is safe because it is designed to attained thermal stability and it uses inert coolant , which is helium .|||11~12~Vform~attain	17~17~ArtOrDet~an
Since VHTR is one of the better options among the generation IV nuclear reactors and it is feasible , we should invest and support in further research and development on VHTR .|||24~25~Prep~
But as the environment issues becomes a high-profile problems and under the situation that this kind of non-renewable resource will be ran out in the near future , people begin to seek some other methods that can support the world as before .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	21~22~Vt~run	29~30~Vt~are beginning
Recently , according to survey nuclear power produces around 11 % of the world 's energy needs and could take more proportion in the future .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~a survey ,
The VHTR system is highly ranked in efficiency not just because of its high nuclear production but also the large hydrogen production , and such kind of by product can also be used in many other industries .|||25~27~ArtOrDet~a

Another issue is that the public concerns about the safety and reliability of the robotic surgery system , for example , the system breakdown in the process of surgery .|||23~24~Vform~breaking down
However , the public can rest assure for this matter because the hospitals have always been doing maintenance for the robotic systems .|||6~7~Vt~assured	7~8~Prep~on	18~19~Prep~of

Therefore , the public should not fear of the robotic surgery and should give confident and trust to the surgeons and the technologies they are using .|||7~8~Prep~	17~18~Prep~
However , the accidents of reactor meltdown and explosion that happened in the past makes the public worried about the safe operation of the nuclear reactors .|||14~15~Vt~made
Whether it is necessary for the further research and development funding for VHTR therefore becomes a big issue that is being widely discussed .|||14~14~Vt~has
A number of oppositions are aroused to stop the funding for the six generation IV reactor concepts because of not only the security risk but the inefficiency and the great cost as well .|||4~6~Vt~were raised

There are arguments that the lack of knowledge of the operators and the technical failure of equipments could not be solved with the application of psychology .|||16~17~Nn~equipment
This incident occurred during a non-routine operation to test ability of turbine , in times of power failure , to produce sufficient power .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~the	11~11~ArtOrDet~the
The behavior of operators should be anticipated and thus engineers could have reduced the complexity of task by providing short and efficient procedure guidelines .|||16~16~ArtOrDet~the
The failure to do so showed that the engineers have overestimated operators ' knowledge of the process .|||9~10~Vt~had	11~11~ArtOrDet~the
( Wilpert.B , 2007 ) In other words , it is unfair to blame the operators as unskilled or inexperience when accidents happened .|||22~24~Vt~happen

But they ignore the enormous benefits of nuclear power There is one proverb saying that " No pain , no gain .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
The SCWR design is quite simpler than current designs , the nuclear reaction release a lot of heat can used to convert of water into steam .|||22~23~Prep~
Therefore , the use of VHTR is safe and we can believe in the further development of such GenIV nuclear reactor concept .|||21~22~Nn~concepts
In addition , these sources of power are being used up and we should find the alternative sources of power .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~

But now , scientists have developed six new type of nuclear reactor called Nuclear Reactor Generation IV which are said to be safer than previous generations .|||8~9~Nn~types	11~12~Nn~reactors
For comparison , VHTR can not reprocess their fuel waste , and because of that , the amount of fuel waste that it produces is getting bigger and bigger as the electricity 's demand increasing ( Rohrer , 2007 ) .|||34~35~Vform~increases
This makes GFR is cheaper to maintain and safer than VHTR which is needed to be checked every time in order to make it operate safely .|||12~14~Vform~needs
It is also more efficient than other reactors , because it can produce the same energy as VHTR with just 850 degrees for temperature .|||18~19~Prep~at
Since then , Nuclear power was often seen as the best alternative energy source as it has no carbon emission and can theoretically produce unlimited amounts of energy since nuclear fuel is inexpensive and abundant on earth .|||24~24~ArtOrDet~an	25~26~Nn~amount
This stigma against nuclear power has led to people such as the general public and environmentalists to favor other alternative energies namely wind energy and solar energy , as they are deemed as better choices .|||7~8~Prep~
However , many of these arguments are based on the short run expenditure that one would face when building a nuclear power plant .|||9~10~Nn~

These measures comprise regular 'force-on-force ' exercises to test the plant 's ability to react to attacks made on the plant , vehicles inspection at greater safety distance away from the plant , improve communication among different government organizations and stricter control to access of restricted sites ( Source : NRC , February 2005 ) .|||44~45~Prep~to
The purpose of these stepped up security measures are to deter any potential terrorist attacks on the nuclear power plants and to have contingency plan in the event of any attacks .|||16~17~Nn~	23~23~ArtOrDet~a
Another reason that the public and environmentalist oppose to the building of nuclear power plants is that the radioactive waste produced by nuclear power plants will remain radioactive for hundred over years .|||6~7~Nn~environmentalists	8~9~Prep~
When the radioactive waste is not properly stored in location that are of safe distance away from people , the people may be exposed to harmful radiation resulting in serious health effects .|||1~2~Nn~

The public is worried that nuclear power tend to have higher operating and maintenance costs which will result in them paying a higher price than that of coal and gas power plant .|||31~32~Nn~plants
According to World Nuclear Association , the price of nuclear power is actually competitive with other types of power plants .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the

The cost of nuclear fuel is as low as 0.5 cents per kilo-watt hour which is one quarter of that of gas power plant .|||21~21~ArtOrDet~a
As compared to conventional nuclear power plant , there is greater efficiency in generating electricity because VHTR can produce fifty percent more electricity output using the same amount of fuel ( The Economics of Nuclear Power by World Nuclear Association , July 2009 ) .|||6~7~Nn~plants
These collaborative efforts resulted in building up six possible nuclear reactor concepts known as the generation IV reactors , however these concepts at that time were still untested and would require years of further extensive research before they can be used in the industry .|||38~39~Vt~could

Another rationale behind the protests against nuclear plants is that it takes a huge capital investment to build up a nuclear plant ( from $ 3 to $ 5 billion dollars ) ( Nuclear Energy Information Service , 2004 ) , to research the new reactors ( approximate 1 billion US dollars for each prototype of generation IV reactors ) ( Nature publishing group , 2004 ) .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~

In my opinion , it is essential to invest in the new nuclear power plant .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~a
First , if the government fosters the research and development in nuclear industry , the cost for building and maintaining the new nuclear power plant will be reduced to an affordable extent .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~	11~11~ArtOrDet~the

Third , the fossil resources are shrinking rapidly , so the cost for coal and oil would increase sharply in the future .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~

Due to the extremely hard reprocessing of its fuel , it deters any means to misusing them it since the process is very complicated .|||15~16~Vform~misuse
( Generation IV International Forum GIF and U.S. Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee NERAC ) This will pose as a threat for the workers at the reactors due to the corrosion of the materials .|||22~23~ArtOrDet~
For the generation IV nuclear reactor systems , the cost of the individual reactors varies and some is far greater costly than the other .|||22~24~Nn~others
In conclusion , both Very high temperature and Lead cooled fast reactors have good performance and excellent safety system , but VHTRs is on a higher end as compared to LFRs due to the greater system performance and system safety it provides .|||18~19~Nn~systems
However , there is no doubt that the energy demand will continue increasing , since human beings can not slow down the pace of technology development .|||12~13~Vform~to increase
In this case , we have to consider more about new energy .|||9~10~Prep~
Some may say that nuclear plant is dangerous , after seeing those nuclear accidents in the last few decades .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a	11~12~ArtOrDet~
However , the generation IV reactors are quite different from the previous ones .|||2~3~Nn~
Yes , they are right , but they are just comparing SWCR with the generation III reactors , not GFR reactor .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~	19~19~ArtOrDet~the
According to the statistics data given by Idaho National Laboratory , the thermal efficiency of SWCR is 43.8 % , which is lower than that of GFR , 48 % .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
Anyway , it is true , but please be noted that most of the budget reports are not able to take all the expenditure into consideration , which of course is not convincible .|||6~10~Vform~note
Although GFR costs more than SWCR according to the budget report , the life of GFR is also longer .|||10~11~Nn~reports
In another word , GFR plant can work a few decades longer than SWCR .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
Another factor is that SWCR only can react under the very high pressure .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
So the maintenance cost also should be taken into account .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
Moreover , GFR has an effective fission of Pu and minor actinides , ability to operate on wide range of fuel composition and capacity for breeding excess fissile material ( Frank Carre , 2002 ) .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~a
So now , people concern most about the security of any kinds of nuclear plants .|||4~5~Vform~are concerned	11~12~Nn~kind
Some think that SWCR is safer than GFR because once accident happen , the pressure of SWCR will decrease immediately , and then the plant will shut down automatically .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~an
Actually , it is not true because safety issue is not only about pressure inside .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
In a conclusion , Gas-cooled Fast Reactor is better than Supercritical Water Cooled Reactor , respectively in the field of efficiency , expend and security .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~	11~13~ArtOrDet~Water-cooled
The accident caused many deaths and resulted in severe health impacts due to the radiation exposed by the population ( Cleveland , 2009 ) .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
On the other hand , the supporters claim that through the use of psychology , the engineers might have anticipated different scenarios that could happen and designed a safer and more stable plant .|||19~19~Vt~has
In other words , the Chernobyl accident might be prevented and with those better safety measures in place , the effects of the accident would be minimized .|||16~16~Vform~were	25~26~Vt~have been
The problem of psychopathology of design is a mismatch of the engineers ' and the operators ' theoretical model which happened in this case .|||18~19~Nn~models
The use of the occupational psychology might aid the engineers in understanding that the operators might not be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to operate the plant .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	7~8~Vform~aided	17~18~Vt~have been

Otherwise , it would have at least weakened the severity of the consequences .|||5~5~Vt~had
The Chernobyl reactor was unstable due to the positive void coefficient which made a power exacerbation uncontrollable .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
However , this instead posed a challenge to psychology to help modify the plant design by the method of feed-forward safety controls which could be applied in the identification for safer designs phase ( Wilpert , 2007 ) .|||15~16~Prep~through
Furthermore , when some reactor components failed to work correctly , the operators faced more stress ( Stang , 1996 ) .|||6~7~Vt~fail	13~14~Vt~face

However , occupational threats and individual work place misfortunes were the focus of psychology as they were influenced by the individual 's motivation , attitude and decision-making ( Wilpert , 2007 ) .|||9~10~Vt~are	16~17~Vt~are
On the contrary , psychology might help the engineers foreseen possible problems during the operation and more safety precautions might be incorporated .|||5~7~Vt~could have helped	18~19~Nn~precaution	19~21~Vt~could have been

A total of 54 people die in this accident CITATION Che091 \ l 2052 ( Chernobyl Accident , 2009 ) .|||5~6~Vt~died
However , the difference is not very much and they fail to consider that the SWCR is working in the environment of very high pressure , while SFR is working in low pressure .|||14~15~ArtOrDet~
On the other hand , the SFR is more sustainable because of its closed fuel cycle and excellent potential of actinide management .|||5~6~ArtOrDet~
Compare this to the SWCR , in a word , sodium-cooled fast reactors do well in performance .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
In terms of cost , proponents of SWCR claim that SWCR has longer history of development while SFR is a newer concept that is just brought up recent years .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~a	23~25~Vt~has just been
People who are against nuclear reactors even claim that the existing method of generate electricity is good enough and new method is not necessary .|||13~14~Vform~generating	19~19~ArtOrDet~a
However , these shortsighted people fail to realize that shortage of resource is already very serious among global .|||11~12~Nn~resources
For SFR , it saves costs in two main methods : the reactor vessel and fuel .|||6~7~Prep~through
The usage of advanced materials , the loop type cooling system and innovative design options are all adopted to save the plant capital costs .|||20~21~ArtOrDet~
For SWCR , it does not recycle the waste ; the nuclear wastes management is also one concern of SWCR in terms of both cost and safety .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	12~13~Nn~waste	18~19~Prep~with
The third point to emphasis is that SFR has the earliest delivery year , 10 years earlier than SWCR .|||4~5~Vform~emphase
For this reason , SFR pay special attention to the safety issue .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Nn~issues
Its operating temperature is as low as the SWCR 's .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~
SFR also recycle the radioactive materials thus decrease the risk of leakage of such dangerous materials .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
SWCR does not recycle the waste which is not that safe .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~
In conclusion , sodium-cooled fast reactor is rated better in performance , cost saving , and safety .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
In this new development , experts have look into 6 new nuclear reactor plant concepts like molten salt reactor ( MSR ) and Very High Temperature Reactor ( VHTR ) .|||7~8~Vform~looked
MSR researchers did intensify research to ensure that it has superior safety standard and fuel cycle qualities than VHTR .|||12~13~Nn~standards
Therefore , the research in MSR cost about $ 1000 million as compared to VHTR 's research which will cost at $ 670 million as quoted from the report on " a technology roadmap for generation IV Nuclear Energy system " .|||2~3~Nn~	18~19~Vt~	20~21~Prep~about
The latter cost only 20 % lesser than the former and the difference in money spend is used to build a generation 4 reactor 's standards .|||20~21~Nn~
Fuel cycle in MSR needs to have more attention as compared to VHTR is because there is a need to ensure that molten salt which is mixed with the nuclear material will still be functional after many rounds of usage in the system .|||28~29~ArtOrDet~
The molten fluoride salts used in the system helps to lower the vapor pressure , thus , reduce stresses on vessel and piping .|||3~4~Nn~salt	11~12~ArtOrDet~
A highly pressurized system is dangerous and need to consistently monitoring to ensure safe operation as stresses acting on the pipes and vessel can cause the system to explode .|||9~9~Vform~be	10~11~Vform~monitored	13~13~ArtOrDet~a
When MSR is operating at high temperature of ranging eight hundred degree and above , it can produce another good energy source .|||11~12~Nn~degrees
Hydrogen can be use to generate power for machines like hydrogen powered car which is clean for the environment .|||12~13~Nn~cars
However , in the case of VHTR , the fuel used is a one through fuel cycle and therefore , it requires proper disposal .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
Molten Salt reactor as compared to Very High Temperature Reactor , the former is a lot safer in performance and operation .|||0~0~ArtOrDet~The	3~13~ArtOrDet~	21~22~ArtOrDet~than the Very High Temperature Reactor
MSR works based on 3 independent sub stations and is a closed loop that interlink with each other to transfer heat energy to electric energy by turning the turbine generator .|||27~27~Prep~on
In any case of industrial accident in one of the system , operators can easily isolate that particular system and rectify the problem as quickly as possible without worrying that the problem might spread to other parts of the other two systems .|||1~2~ArtOrDet~
As for VHTR , it has only one open loop system to produce the electricity from heat .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~
The waste products produced by the current old nuclear plants can not be recycle and need to be disposed at wasteland .|||13~14~Vform~recycled
If these wastes landed on the wrong hands like terrorists , the world will be in chaos as we live in fear of nuclear attacks by unknown enemies .|||13~14~Vt~would
Therefore , the Generation 4 nuclear reactor plants like MSR , it recycle its waste products and does not need to dispose them .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	17~18~Vform~do
However , in VHTR , as mentioned earlier , it produces wastes and researchers are trying to find solution to it .|||18~19~Nn~solutions
Its performance in low pressure quality can help to reduce stresses on equipment and lesser chances of industrial accident than a high pressure system which induce high stress to the equipments .|||18~19~Nn~accidents	30~31~Nn~equipment
It is safer than VHTR as it has better safety standard .|||10~11~Nn~standards
Lastly , in the area of security , MSR will not create chances of producing waste that will land on the wrong hands like the terrorist as compared to VHTR which have to deal with secured and proper waste disposal .|||25~26~Nn~terrorists
Recent years , we can see that nuclear power is one of the main sources for generating electrical energy .|||4~6~Vt~have seen

Ever since the Three Miles Island incident , many new safety regulations had been implemented and also in SCWR , emergency plans had been set up to prevent such things from happening again .|||12~13~Vt~have	22~23~Vt~have
Normally , the economics of nuclear reactors are basic construction costs , operating cost , the life-time of the plant and the rate of return on capital ( Solar Energy Systems ) .|||13~14~Nn~costs
Critics often said that the overall cost for using nuclear energy had increased over the years and was relatively high ( Jack & Nicolas , 2008 ) .|||11~12~Vt~has

Comparing this with the open human surgeries , patients can only return to their daily activities after 4 to 6 weeks .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~
When it comes to the patients ' safety , some questions such as the reliability of surgical robots are raised by the public .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~

This will enhance safety for patients .|||4~5~Prep~of
Although the cost of the surgery is high , given the high quality provided from the robots such as shorter hospital stays , faster recovery and safe operation , surgical robots is therefore encouraged worldwide .|||31~32~Vt~should	33~33~Vform~be
On the contrary , there are still some concerns on using nuclear energy : The most important one is about the safety of nuclear power plant its potential radioactive pollution .|||9~10~Prep~about	25~26~Nn~plants
Another problem is the performance of nuclear power plant with respect to its cost .|||8~9~Nn~plants
Since it is much more expensive than usually used firepower plant , whether nuclear power plant can provide electricity efficiently with a reasonable cost became a rather essential problem .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	15~16~ArtOrDet~plants
However , according to the design , SFR is an entirely closed system containing nuclear fuel and Sodium that can only touch with the inner surface of the reactor .|||22~23~Prep~
More specifically , its power supply can range from a few hundred MW ( e ) for Mid-Size plant to 1500- 1700 MW ( e ) for Large Monolithic plant ( " A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems " , 2002 ) .|||17~17~ArtOrDet~a	27~27~ArtOrDet~a
However , VHTR only can be built as Large Monolithic plant .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~a
That means SFR is able to meet requirement of economic factors in different situations better than other reactors .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the	11~12~Prep~of
Hence , the SFR still can meet the performance and economist requirement in the future .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~	11~12~Nn~requirements

Finally , most of the technology challenge can be overcome .|||6~7~Nn~challenges
First of all , according to the table , the MSRs are safer to operate and maintain than most of other reactors .|||20~20~ArtOrDet~the
Moreover , Molten salt reactor costs less than other reactors under development which is indicated in the table .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~a
What is more , in the core of reactor , the pressure is relatively low .|||8~8~ArtOrDet~the
Instead , the low pressure pipes built of thin sheets of metal are used .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
In addition , the efficiency is raised effectively due to the high temperature , which accordingly reduces the use of fuel and the cost of complementary equipment by 50 % or more .|||3~4~ArtOrDet~	10~11~ArtOrDet~
{ ( GIF , 2007 ) } [ HYPERLINK : http : //www.gen-4.org/Technology/systems/msr.htm ] These properties imply that MSRs can work in small sizes , which reduces the cost of land and construction .|||25~27~Vform~reducing

Thus , nuclear power is not as dangerous compared to other sources of energy and the VHTR can be made safer with modern technologies .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
In conclusion , coal and oil are no longer sources of energy that we should rely on because of their rising costs and environmental impacts .|||24~25~Nn~impact
Currently , generating power using nuclear reactor , VHTR , will be our best choice since it has zero emission , cheap , safe and efficient .|||5~5~Nn~the
Thus , the research on VHTR should be continued and funded to get ourselves ready before the demand for energy increase by one fold in year 2050 as predicted ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
The first reason about why it is good to fund and support the development of nuclear energy for future energy consumption is about the limitation of energy resources .|||3~4~Prep~	22~23~Prep~
The main energy resources human beings consumed today is coal , oil , natural gas and some other non-renewable resources .|||6~7~Vt~consume
People may argue that we still have enough resources in the following centuries , however , according to the survey done by the world geographers , the oil will be used up 40 years later if human beings continue using oil like they do now .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~a	22~23~ArtOrDet~	26~27~ArtOrDet~

The nuclear energy now is hot and it will show its great use in the next few centuries ( Gerstner , 2009 ) .|||0~1~ArtOrDet~

The generation = 4 \ * ROMAN IV reactors can really reduce the production of green house gases ( Butler , 2004 ) .People may argue that there are many accidents happened related to nuclear reactors .|||31~31~Vt~have
Although the possibility of accidents exist , under strict management and a more and more perfect technology , the number of accidents will reduce and nuclear energy will be a kind of energy that environmental friendly and the public should fund its development .|||23~24~Vform~be reduced
People always say the economic development will depend on the comprehensive national strength , or the national power , not the nuclear energy , however , they may not see the importance of nuclear energy in improving it .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~	15~16~ArtOrDet~
If we can support and fund the nuclear energy for future development , it will enhance the speed of economy development .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~

Specifically , compared with Molten Salt Reactor ( MSR ) , the VHTR is safer , incurs low operation and maintenance costs and modular construction costs .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the
The MSR operates at the temperature of 700-800 º C and low pressures .|||12~13~Nn~pressure
Thus , the VHTR would incur higher cost of installing since it needs thicker pipes to sustain the high pressure .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~a
However , the VHTR which operates at a higher temperature is highly efficient in conversion of heat to electricity compared to the MSR .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~the
Moreover , additional technologies R&D for the VHTR includes high temperature alloy , fiber reinforced ceramics and composite materials can further improve the efficiency and cut down the costs ( U.S. Department of Energy Nuclear , 2002 ) .|||8~9~Vform~includeing
For instance , an optimized approach for dealing with graphite is currently under research .|||6~7~Prep~to
Thus , the VHTR is much cheaper than the MSR in overall costs .|||12~13~Nn~cost
Some people might have wrong assumption that the MSR have higher performance than the VHTR since it is a fast reactor that relies on fast neutrons while the later one is a thermal reactor that relies on moderators to slow neutrons first .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
However , this is not true because the reactors ' performances are also depends on the temperature and pressure .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
In fact , the overall plant efficiency of the VHTR is more than 50 % whereas compared to MSR around 44 -50 % .|||19~20~Prep~
In addition , the VHTR is operating in a midsized plant as compared to the MSR which is a large in size .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore , the MSR discard larger amount of waste compare to the VHTR .|||5~5~ArtOrDet~a
Even though the waste from the MSR is then undergoing recycling , but this process is unsecure as this bypasses the stage where plutonium , an active ingredient for nuclear weapons , is produced .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~	7~10~Vt~undergoes

From analysis , the VHTR will spend fuel in a symbiotic fuel cycle that can achieve significant reductions in waste quantity and radio toxicity because of its ability to accommodate a wide variety mixture of fissile and fertile materials without significantly modification of the core design ( U.S. Department of Energy Nuclear , 2002 ) .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the	33~34~Nn~mixtures	41~43~Vform~modifying

When it comes to the cost , many people may think building the nuclear reactors is quite an expensive process .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~
At the same time , the alternatives have to be cleaner so that current global warming situation will not be aggravated ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the

Among the Generation IV nuclear reactors , the SCWR has the lowest development cost which is based on the economics , safety and sustainability factors ( Cogeneration Technologies , 2003 ) .|||18~19~ArtOrDet~
Comparing with other forms of Generation IV reactors , the SCWR does not require high development cost as it is using existing technologies such as Light Water Reactors ( LWRs ) and supercritical fossil-fired boilers .|||19~21~Vt~uses
Although there are critics highlighted that further research and development is required for the systems components ( such as vessel and pressure tubes ) , which in turn demands for more funds .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~	29~30~Prep~

In the design of GFR system , combined systems of both active cooling and passive cooling is applied : active systems are used to remove the decays of heat at high power level then passive systems will take over after 24 hours when decay heat is reduced to 0.5 % .The active part defends the system at the first place and the passive part only dues with the pressure achieved after depressurization .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~the	56~57~Prep~in

In their conservative view , they always care more about the how productive and reliable of the machines are and neglect to focus on the role of humans in safeguarding .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~	15~16~Prep~
But from the previous analysis of the Chernobyl nuclear accidents , we can see that correct human actions are indispensable in preventing the disaster .|||9~10~Nn~accident

On the contrary , focusing on improve the management in the engineering processes is already a way of applying social psychology .|||10~11~ArtOrDet~

The SFR boasts a recycling system where 99.9 % of the actinides are recycled back to as fuels , such as plutonium and since the SFR is a closed fuel system , fuel can be used again in the system .|||15~16~Prep~
On the other hand the VHTR is more expensive to build ; materials have to withstand high temperatures as well as high pressures .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~its
Though the capital cost of the VHTR is high the operational cost is comparatively less since the VHTR is highly efficient at higher temperature and hence is a good solution to get cheaper electricity .|||23~24~Nn~temperatures

Opponents of nuclear energy might argue that the radioactive waste which will be produced by the nuclear reactors is susceptible to accidents due to human intervention .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~
However , researchers could only suggest better solutions for the nuclear plants to produce less radioactive waste but not to the extent of eliminating radioactive waste till today .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~
Military protection in nuclear plants is another factor that should be considered in the security of the nuclear plants .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~

Critics may argue that the environmental effects caused by the nuclear accidents are dangerous and harmful .|||9~10~ArtOrDet~

Also , instead of having the traditional feedback controls of safety , use of psychology predicts the consequences of having mistakes in design and take corrective actions immediately , this will greatly reduce the probability of accidents occurring due to design errors .|||12~12~ArtOrDet~the
Adopting psychology in the initial or design phase of the project seems to benefit in short term , however , it may not be beneficial in the long term .|||15~15~ArtOrDet~the

It was later discovered that the storage tank alarm system has not been working for four years and flare system is down for five months ( E.Ingrid , 2004 ) Therefore , if a superintendent of a company shows no concern about safety , it is very likely that workers will take on the similar stand in long run .|||10~11~Vt~had	18~18~ArtOrDet~the	20~21~Vt~had been	53~54~ArtOrDet~a	57~57~ArtOrDet~the

In my opinion , deficiency in psychology guidance were the main causes , as the accident would be prevented if decision makers act more rationally and the concerns of engineers from { Morton Thiokol } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Thiokol ] and Rockwell International were recognized .|||11~12~Nn~cause	17~18~Vt~have been	20~20~ArtOrDet~the	22~23~Vt~had acted

To maximize level of energy output , it seems that the Very-High-Temperature Reactor ( VHTR ) , which could achieve 50 % efficiency level when deployed , is a better choice .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the

Since the introduction of nuclear-powered generators , public opposition was one of the reasons why only limited nuclear reactors have been built in the past .|||9~10~Vt~is
Their concern arose because of a few incidents that have happened in the past which includes a partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania and also the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , which the reactor core exploded and caused the death of 31 people and spewed radioactive debris across Europe ( Butler , 2004 ) .|||2~3~Vt~arises
Nevertheless , the first reason that the public is concerned over the funding of generation IV nuclear reactors is that the nuclear reactors will not reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions as compared to natural gas and oil use ( Nature , 2008 ) .|||26~27~ArtOrDet~
According to Ruth ( 2009 ) , medical isotopes used in the cancer research can be supplied using accelerators instead of nuclear reactors as it is a safer and cheaper method .|||11~12~ArtOrDet~

This can be shown as many researchers were lamenting on the shutdown of the nuclear reactor located in chalk river , Ontario , and their medical research has to be put to a halt ( Nature , 2008 ) .|||27~28~Vt~had
Thus , the public opposition should look at the new generation IV reactors in a different light and not just based on some of the incidents that had happened in the past .|||27~28~Vt~
In addition , the new SFR will be equipped with better coolant system to prevent a reactor meltdown and stronger containment structures to guard against terrorist attacks ( Smith , 2009 ) .|||10~10~ArtOrDet~a
Thus , less research will be required for the SFR , which also means that the research cost will be reduced .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
Furthermore , by choosing the SFR 's proven method of cooling the nuclear core , it removes the uncertainties of using new and untested technology which are present in the other reactors .|||24~25~Nn~technologies

Plutonium is also included in this group and it can be used for production of nuclear weapons .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the

Unfortunately , there are so many hue and cries in generation today that the public spending on the elderly should be limited for the sake of country 's development .|||13~14~ArtOrDet~	26~26~ArtOrDet~the
However , I opine that the public spending on the aged should not be limited because not only the elderly will get the benefits from the spending but indirectly the society will get the benefits in any sphere .|||23~24~Nn~benefit	29~30~ArtOrDet~

Another bane of contention is that the public spending on education can be reduced .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
This is because when there is no limitation in public spending on elderly will lighten the burden of generation today .|||8~9~Prep~on	12~12~ArtOrDet~the

Due to the large population of the elderly , the aging issue is raising more and more concerns in the current society .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
One of the concerns is that the governments need to spend a greater expense on the elderly to ensure their physical living standard as well as their psychological conditions .|||6~7~ArtOrDet~
The governments should invest on other areas so that the development of the country will ultimately resolve the aging problems .|||4~5~Prep~in
I strongly agree that with this argument that the improved country competency will benefit the elderly-concerned issues since the technology advancement can enhance the country productivity , the economic growth will ensure the continuation of the welfare program .|||15~17~Vt~

Addressing other issues that contributes to a country 's development such as the economic growth , education and military is just as important .|||12~13~ArtOrDet~	18~18~ArtOrDet~the

Therefore , these people usually do not have any incomes .|||9~11~Nn~income

For example , in Singapore , the high cost of living is actually caused by the spending of the people on necessities like financial products and transportation ( Tan K. L. 2008 ) .|||15~16~ArtOrDet~

It is important for the society to show its appreciation for the contribution made by the elderly .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~

As the majority of the older people believed that the government should provide for them as they are at their most vulnerable ( Shanas , 1980 ) , the reduction in public spending on them will set up a framework for criticism against the government who showed no appreciation for the sweat and toils that they had willingly given .|||45~47~Vt~show	53~54~Nn~toil	56~57~Vt~have

Therefore , other strategies should also be introduced to cope with the problem of aging population .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~an
For example , the better-off should try to support their own elderly parents through ways such as giving them monthly allowance etc. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore has also made a National Day Rally Speech this year to stress on filial obligation for parent maintenance .|||19~19~ArtOrDet~a	41~42~Prep~
In addition , the money spent on country 's development in the area of education and economy can also help to solve the problems of an aging population .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~the
However , when making decisions on government spending , the government should also take into consideration the existence of other problems and the need to improve other areas of country .|||29~29~ArtOrDet~the
The majority of the population is still the young who are now sweating and toiling for the country just like what the aged had done in the past .|||20~25~Vt~the aged did
Hence the government should also divert some of the resources to improve the lives of these people such as subsidies for birth-giving , which not only reduces the cost burden of having a child but also encourages people to have more children , thus increasing the replacement rate .|||11~12~Vform~improving

The government could establish a bottom line stating the how much to spend , on what aspects of healthcare to spend , how much of a particular facility an individual could use and to what extent .|||8~9~ArtOrDet~
Since there is economic growth , government would have more resources and hence require less taxes , as a consequence a family would be able to increase its spending on its older members .|||6~6~ArtOrDet~the
To top things off , economic growth would allow increase in spending in R " D so the medical facilities would be more technologically advanced and be cheaper to produce due to superior technology , hence services from such facilities would become cheaper and hence spending overall would fall .|||9~9~ArtOrDet~an

Lastly , carriers of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives as it would aid their relatives in decision makings .|||23~24~Nn~making
In all , carriers have the obligation to inform their family members their genetic test results since the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages .|||12~12~Prep~of

When a person is found to be a carrier though genetic testing , problem is arise as to whether the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as a carrier will not get the disease but the carrier can pass the disease to his or her children ( Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic Testing , 2009 ) .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the	14~16~Vform~arises	31~32~ArtOrDet~the
Secondly , the carrier can get moral support from the family member despite the fact that the carrier might face discrimination upon disclosure of results .|||11~12~Nn~members
A carrier should tell his or her relatives as they might be in risk of getting the disease or being a carrier too ( Lea , Williams and Donahue , 2005 ) .|||12~13~Prep~at
This is because the carrier got the disease through his or her parent , and thus the carrier 's siblings and the carrier 's children might have also gotten the altered gene .|||9~12~ArtOrDet~a

Knowing more about a risk of having a disease may help people to be more aware of its phenomenon , as well as more concern on their health ( Cancer.net , 2009 ) .|||25~26~Prep~about

In conclusion,because it is a right of humans to know about the risk they are having , the carriers of disorders must tell his or her relatives about it .|||14~16~Vform~have
Therefore , individual should have the final say whether to reveal the results of their own genetic testing .|||2~3~Nn~individuals
Supporting this notion , evidences from a government case study suggests that individual withholding genetic information from people , who may need to know , is not a common occurrence .|||4~5~Nn~evidence	12~13~Nn~individuals
In addition , desirability of sharing information with family members is also emphasized through counseling and doctor 's persuading , but not made a condition as it does not supersede the individual 's right to privacy .|||3~3~ArtOrDet~the
This however , is judged on a case by case basis , and is only approved if an individual 's decision causes potential damage rather than mere inconvenience and if the reason for refusal to give permission has evidences of malice .|||38~39~Nn~evidence

However , there is an issue of whether these results should also be made known to the relatives of the individuals .|||16~17~ArtOrDet~
On one hand , the relatives of the individual should be given the right to know about it since it concerns them as well .|||4~5~ArtOrDet~

Once you got some negative information about your genes as regards to these kinds of incurable diseases , the only thing you can do is just wait to die .|||11~12~Prep~
So individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since it would cause serious psychological effect on people who do not want to know the results .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~the
would be the discrimination in the society .|||2~3~Nn~
This kind of discrimination mainly regards to the unfairness on insurance coverage and employment .|||7~8~ArtOrDet~

If there is a great probability that freedom does harm to the society , it should definitely be banned .|||11~12~Nn~
But these people put too much belief on the genetic technology .|||8~9~Nn~
Thirdly , people may also argue that , for a society , in order to obtain the optimal benefits , it has to reject people who get genetic problems .|||16~17~Nn~

Genetic testing is a technology which screens and examines the genes of a person to check whether he has a specific genetic disorders or diseases which are not able to be detected using common medical procedures .|||19~20~ArtOrDet~
This technology is one of modern technologies and has many effects in human life .|||11~12~Prep~on
First , the result affects the future of one family as the genetic disorder can be inherited to the next generation and in event that some members of the family have this genetic disorder too .|||17~18~Prep~by
After knowing the result , a couple should find ways to treat the disease before they are giving birth to a child because the child has big possibility to have the gene which is dangerous for the future of the child ( Otto 2007 ) .|||16~18~Vt~give	26~26~Vt~a

Second , the reason someone should not disclose his testing result is concerning the psychological impact on the person and his family ( Anonymous 1993 ) .|||11~13~Vt~concerns
Nevertheless , if one discloses it by himself for a long time , he will get more and more depressed which will then ruin his life .|||6~7~Prep~to
In addition , their family will finally find out about the disease when the disease causes his health become worse and this will make the family feels regret because if they know it earlier , they can find treatment for him .|||18~18~Vform~to	26~27~Vform~feel	31~32~Vt~has known	36~38~Vt~could have found
Third , the test result has great effect in one 's career life and one is obliged to tell the employer about the result .|||6~6~Vt~a	8~9~Prep~on
For example , for a worker who has genetic disorder on his skins should not work in an area that has radiation .|||3~4~Prep~	12~13~Nn~skin
Some argue that a genetic elimination in choosing worker is discrimination because this is an action of limiting one 's right to work ( Andre and Velasquez 2009 ) .|||3~4~Nn~
However , the genetic testing is to ensure the safety of all workers .|||2~3~Nn~
The worker who has genes disease can be not ne hired but this for the life of people around him .|||4~4~ArtOrDet~a
In conclusion , one who has genetic disorder or disease is obliged to reveal the genetic testing result he has because by revealing it , there are several benefits for him , his family and people around him .|||17~18~Nn~results
His family and he can find ways to cure the disease , a couple can prepare treatment for their child , one can have a right job to do , and he can prevent the disease to cause danger for people around him .|||39~40~Prep~to
Thus , when a carrier of a known genetic risk discloses the results with his or her relatives , more people will be able to take precautionary measures if tested positive .|||13~14~Prep~to

Potential individuals who are at risk of developing a genetic disorder or disease normally undergo for genetic testing .|||15~16~Prep~
The revelation of genetically tested patients ' results may lead to discrimination by society ( Mehlman , 1999 ) .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
However , there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by society that have been imposed ( Bombard , 2007 ) .|||13~13~ArtOrDet~the
This is because no one has the rights to give his or her consent regarding the decision on whether to undergo for the prenatal examinations or not ( Anonymous , 1999 ) .|||21~22~Prep~

Genetic testing is actually the genetic diagnosis of inheritable diseases which caused by an abnormality in an individual 's genome .|||11~11~Vform~are

Firstly , it is important to reveal the result if a couple is planning to get married and one of them has any inheritable diseases .|||22~23~ArtOrDet~certain

In even extreme cases , if the child is born , it will be burden for them to take care of him .|||14~14~ArtOrDet~a
Since this genetic testing begins with an affected family member , it provides the best opportunity to identify relative who may be at risk for a life- threatening condition .|||18~19~Nn~relatives
Critics of this position may argue that disclosure brings with it the potential for loss of privacy .|||13~14~Prep~
Hence , carrier of genetic disease must be obligated to tell the genetic testing result since the welfare of family members can be improved .|||2~2~ArtOrDet~the
If an individual is failed to do so , family relation may comes to an end and undergoes mental trauma and depression .|||3~5~Vt~fails	12~13~Vform~come
The issue is that after an individual undergo genetic testing and unfortunately found out that there are problems within him or herself , is the individual obligated to tell his or her family members ?|||12~13~Vt~finds
With the information that the individual acquired through genetic testing , he or she can share with the family members so that they can tackle the problems head on .|||6~7~Vt~acquires
However the risk genes carrier may argue that to tell the information to his or her family member is a violation towards his or her autonomy .|||21~22~Prep~of
Therefore the risk gene carrier should be obliged to tell the family members if he or she has genetic risk within them .|||18~18~ArtOrDet~a
As science and technology progressed , we could now detect the presence of any genetic disorder in individual through genetic testing .|||4~5~Vt~progress	7~8~Vt~can	17~17~ArtOrDet~an
However , one biggest problem that arises is whether the individual , who had undergone the genetic test , be obligated to inform his family members/relatives the results .|||13~14~Vt~has	26~26~Prep~of
In this example , a pregnant relative seeking genetic counseling and his geneticist requires information about the individual in order to give her the most accurate information whether her new-born has any risk of genetic disorder .|||30~31~Vt~will have
If the individual declined her request as he wished that the information about his genetic status to be confidential , her new-born could be in high risk of getting the genetic disorder ( Elizabeth A .|||3~4~Vt~declines	8~9~Vt~wants	25~25~ArtOrDet~a
Secondly , acquisition of genetic information of carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease .|||7~7~ArtOrDet~a
For example , the genetic disorder is colon cancer ; they can seek out for medical advices and treatment while it is at early stage .|||16~17~Nn~advice	23~23~ArtOrDet~an
In addition , his relatives will understand better by going for counseling that everyone carries gene mutations that can lead to disease , and no one has control over what they pass on to their children ( Elizabeth A .|||21~22~Nn~diseases
Since genetic disease runs in the family , a genetic disease carrier 's family members and relatives will have high chance of developing the same inherited disease .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~a	19~19~ArtOrDet~a
Such tragic incident will re-occur if a carrier of a known genetic risk were to hide his or her condition from his or her family members and relatives .|||3~4~Vt~would

What is more , people may be reluctant to undergo testing for that they can not decide by their own .|||17~18~Prep~on

After which , the doctor would order for more specific tests to narrow down to the specific cause , and this may take a few days in specialist clinics .|||7~8~Prep~
However , with the knowledge of the possibility of genetic disease , it enables the medical physician to narrow down to specific testing and get the correct diagnosis earlier .|||2~3~Prep~	9~9~ArtOrDet~a
However , some argued that genetic testing can potentially unravel family secrets ; namely adoptions and illegitimate child ( Doukas & Berg , 2001 ) .|||3~4~Vt~argue
But such issues can be solved since we can select results to be in terms of potential disease , instead of paternity testing .|||17~18~Nn~diseases
Firstly , individual who have undergone genetic testing , should be obligated inform his or her relatives of the genetic testing result as they may also be equally at risk .|||12~12~Vform~to

The new millennium brought about promising medical advancements that have positive impacts on human 's lives .|||10~10~Vt~had
Thus individual of known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal test results to relatives because it brings awareness concerning the risk of inheriting the disease to the foreground , not only to the person tested , but for his or her relatives as well .|||1~1~ArtOrDet~an
This is a bias claim because it failed to consider at-risk relatives ' rights to know about the test results .|||3~4~Vform~biased
When individuals chose not to reveal the results , it is mainly because of the following reasons : the fear of discrimination , fear of being a burden to the family or not wanting to worry their families .|||2~3~Vt~choose
This is a selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem .|||2~3~ArtOrDet~
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives as it not only allows them to escape from early deaths through changes in their lifestyles but also contributes to the safety of third parties .|||29~30~Nn~death

A person will usually feel depress and even suffers emotional breakdown when he knows that he suffers from a certain disease what more if it is a disease inherited from his parents , thus when his family knows about his condition , they can persuade , paying more attention to him and even encourage him to go for treatment and not to give up .|||8~9~Vt~suffer	46~47~Vform~pay
